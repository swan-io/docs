# Block & unblock physical cards

:::caution Blocked for incorrect PIN attempts
If a card was blocked without request, it might be because the cardholder made too many [incorrect attempts to enter their PIN](./index.mdx#pin-incorrect-attempts).

In this case, you need to wait 24 hours before you can unblock the card, and the cardholder must enter their PIN at an ATM.
:::

## Temporarily block a physical card {#block}

You can temporarily suspend a physical card with the `suspendPhysicalCard` mutation.

## Unblock a physical card {#unblock}

To unblock a physical card with the `resumePhysicalCard` mutation, you must:

- Be signed in.
- Use a user access token in the name of the card's account member.

A `consentUrl` is returned inviting the user to start the Strong Customer Authentication with Swan.

If **you chose to block the card**, the card can be used immediately after you unblock it.

## Unblock after 3 incorrect PIN attempts {#unblock-pin}

If a card was blocked because the PIN was entered incorrectly 3 times, the **cardholder** must wait 24 hours, then enter their PIN at an ATM before the card can be used again.

- The cardholder needs to enter the **original PIN** ([a card's PIN never changes](./index.mdx#pin)).
- You can [view their PIN with the API](./guide-view-info.mdx#view-pin).
- If you use Swan's Web Banking interface, the [cardholder can view their PIN](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/16423151195677-View-card-numbers-and-PIN#h_01HND9G193R7CQV275TSGZ59RC) themselves.
