:::caution Use token immediately
{props.overview}, **use it immediately** to **verify which user is logged in**.

Adding a `phoneNumber` to the OAuth 2.0 URL in step 2.1 **isn't sufficient** to know which user is logged in.
Sometimes, a phone number might have been used by a [deactivated user](../../../topics/users/index.mdx#deactivate) before being used for a new user. It's impossible to detect this situation, so it's **crucial to verify the user associated with the user access token**.
