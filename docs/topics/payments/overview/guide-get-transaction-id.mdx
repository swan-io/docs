## API guide

Queries are highly customizable.
This guide focuses solely on using the `transactions` query to get transaction IDs.
Learn more about this query in the guide to [get transaction information](./guide-get-transaction-info.mdx).

1. Call the `transactions` query.
1. Check the boxes for `edges` and `node`.
1. Under `node`, check the boxes for `id`, `createdAt`, and `label`.
   - `label` often contains a name, which might be helpful.
   - `createdAt` could help you identity the payment ID you're searching for if you know when the payment was initiated.
   - Additionally, you might choose to get only the `first` 10 IDs on the list, use [pagination](../../../developers/using-api/pagination.mdx) to filter further, or add a `totalCount`.
