# Capital deposits

import CapitalDepositDefinition from "../definitions/_capital-deposit.mdx";

> <CapitalDepositDefinition />

When **creating a new company**, you're required to **deposit your share capital** before registering the company.

## Overview {#overview}

Several key stakeholders are involved in the capital deposit process: **you**; **your client**, their future company, and their shareholders; **Swan** (and Swan's API); and Swan's partner **notary**.

The capital deposit process consists of a few main actions:

- Creating a Swan capital deposit case to collect everything
- Creating Swan accounts
- Verifying identities
- Uploading documents
- Transferring funds

Learn more about the stakeholders and their interactions to complete a capital deposit on this page before continuing to the [guide for ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France](./france/guide.mdx).

## Capital deposit case {#case}

The [`CapitalDepositCase`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/capital-deposit-case) API object compiles all information for a capital deposit case, including:

1. Details about the future company
1. Company account
1. Shareholder information
1. Capital deposit documents

| Case status | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `WaitingForInitialRequirements` | The case has been initiated and is waiting for shareholder verification, fund transfers, document uploads, and completion of company onboarding. |
| `PendingInternalReview` | Swan is reviewing the information and documents provided. |
| `WaitingForAdditionalInformation` | After review, Swan has requested additional details or corrections from the customer and is awaiting their response. |
| `WaitingForNotaryShareDepositCertificate` | **_Notary reviews_** _the deposited funds and submitted documents, then creates the certificate and uploads it to Swan_. |
| `WaitingForRegisterExtract` | The end-user uploads their register extract for notary review. |
| `WaitingForNotaryTransfer` | **_Notary reviews_** _the register extract_. If the document is rejected by either Swan or the notary, the case will move back to `WaitingForRegisterExtract`. |
| `Canceled` | The case was canceled before completion by either you or Swan. |
| `Completed` | Notary reviewed and approved all elements and transferred the funds to the new company; the process is complete. |

## Required documents {#documents}

Processing your capital shares deposit **requires several documents**.
These can be uploading using the API.
Documents must meet Swan's requirements; otherwise, the document will be assigned the status `Refused` and you'll need to upload the document again.

### List of required documents {#documents-list}

All documents are **mandatory** unless marked _if requested_.

```

| Document status | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `Pending`   | Place for the document is created, but the document isn't uploaded yet. |
| `Uploaded`  | Document successfully uploaded; you can change and re-upload the document as long it retains the status `Uploaded`<br/><br/>**Next step**: Swan reviews the document and either validates or refuses it. |
| `Validated` | Swan validated the document. |
| `Refused`   | Document doesn't meet requirements.<br/><br/>**Next step**: Upload a new document, then the status returns to `Uploaded`. |

## Shareholders {#shareholders}

A shareholder is a physical or legal person who deposits funds in exchange for ownership of the future company.
In order to deposit funds, the shareholder opens a **temporary** Swan payment account.

Because they're opening an account, each shareholder must go through the [onboarding](../onboarding/index.mdx), [identification](../users/identifications/index.mdx), and [account holder verification](../onboarding/account-holders/index.mdx#verification-process) processes.
After completing requirements, the shareholder's account is assigned an IBAN they can use to deposit funds.

As soon as the `CapitalDepositCase` is complete, the shareholder's temporary account **closes automatically**.

Shareholders must provide proof of their residence address.
Only official documents are validated.
Refer to the **list of acceptable documents** in the [Partnership Document Center](../../partnership/document-center/proof-address/index.mdx).

```

| Shareholder status | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `PendingOnboarding` | Default status after the shareholder is created; shareholder must **complete their onboarding** and their **account must be created** to continue. |
| `WaitingForVerification` | Possible status if the account holder verification isn't complete at the moment the shareholder's account is created.<br/><br/>_Status bypassed if the [account holder status](../onboarding/account-holders/index.mdx#verification-process) is already `Verified`_. |
| `WaitingForTransfer` | Waiting for the shareholder to deposit the full share capital in their Swan account created during onboarding, which **must** be transferred from an account belonging to the shareholder. |
| `CapitalTransferred` | Waiting for the rest of the capital deposit case to be ready and the funds to be transferred to the notary. |
| `CapitalFundsWiredToNotary` | Still waiting for the rest of the capital deposit case to be ready, but now the funds are with the notary. |
| `CapitalDepositCanceled` | When a [`CapitalDepositCase` is `Canceled`](#case-statuses), the shareholder status changes to `CapitalDepositCanceled`.<br/><br/>If an account was already created for the shareholder, the account is also closed automatically. |

## Updating a shareholder's deposit amount {#update-amount}

You can update a shareholder's deposit amount directly through the API.

import UpdateShareholderPrereqs from './partials/_update-shareholder-prereqs.mdx';

<UpdateShareholderPrereqs />

Updating a shareholder's deposit amount automatically triggers a recalculation of the total capital deposit amount for the case.

Follow the guide to [update a shareholder's capital deposit amount](./guide-update-shareholder-amount.mdx).

## Canceling a capital deposit {#cancel}

If needed, it's possible to cancel an ongoing capital deposit.

import CancelCase from './partials/_cancel-case.mdx';

<CancelCase />

Follow the guide to [cancel a capital deposit](./guide-cancel.mdx).
