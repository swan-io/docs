# Partnership with Swan

Your partnership with Swan provides you **access to banking services** without needing to become a **regulated financial agent**.

**Offering banking services is a complex business** with high potential for fraud, money laundering, and more, requiring a **highly supervised license**.
Obtaining a license to offer banking services, however, is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive.

## Swan's license {#license}

Swan holds an [e-money license](https://www.regafi.fr/spip.php?page=results&type=advanced&id_secteur=3&lang=en&denomination=Swan&siren=853827103&cib=17328&bic=&nom=&siren_agent=&num=&cat=0&retrait=0) valid across the [European Economic Area](./country-coverage.mdx) (EEA) overseen by France's [Autorit√© de Contr√¥le Prudentiel et R√©solution](https://acpr.banque-france.fr/en) (ACPR).
In English, ACPR translates to *Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority*.

Because Swan holds the license, **Swan assumes responsibility for all sensitive and risky banking operations**.
While many operations can be delegated to you, some are always performed by Swan for regulatory purposes.
For example, consent is *always* required for [sensitive operations](../topics/consent/index.mdx#sensitive), and consent *always* involves Swan in a Live environment.

## Your legal status {#legal-status}

Your legal status while partnering with Swan depends on the country in which your company is based: in France, or anywhere else in the European Economic Area (EEA).

| Location | Status |
| --- | --- |
| üá´üá∑ France | You'll operate as a **Registered Swan Intermediary**.<br /><br />Learn more in the [dedicated guide for France](./countries/france/guide-orias.mdx). |
| All other EEA countries | You'll operate as a **Commercial Agent of Swan**.<br /><br />You don't have to complete a regulatory process to become a Commercial Agent. Swan handles it once you go Live. |

## Three-party partnership model {#model}

To ensure that Swan doesn't delegate any risk to you, Swan must have a direct relationship with your users, the end consumers of Swan's banking product.

### Rates {#model-rates}

- Rate 1: You charge your users fees for your services based on your Terms and Conditions.

Your rates (rate 1 in the diagram), or the fees you charge your users for your Swan offer, should be defined in your Terms and Conditions.

### Swan and your users {#model-swan-users}

This direct relationship, meaning direct contact between Swan and your users, is used primarily during the [identity verification](../topics/onboarding/account-holders/index.mdx#verifying-account-holders) and [Strong Customer Authentication](../topics/consent/index.mdx#sca) processes.

When your users open Swan accounts, they must accept Swan's Terms and Conditions, sent by email.
As defined in the Terms and Conditions, your user accepts that some you can perform certain operations:

1. Consult the account and the e-money account.
1. Transmit information to Swan to open an account or e-money account.
1. Prepare card orders.
