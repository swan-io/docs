# Get a payment ID

You can get payment IDs with the API or on your Dashboard.

## Dashboard

All payment IDs for your project are on your Dashboard.

1. On your Dashboard, go to **Data** > **Transactions**.
1. **Open** a transaction connected to the payment you're searching for.
This will redirect you to a transaction page for a specific account.

## API guide

Queries are highly customizable.
This guide focuses solely on using the `payment` query to get payment IDs. 
Learn more about this query in the guide to [get payment information](./guide-get-payment-info.mdx).

1. Call the `payments` query.
1. Check the boxes for `edges` and `node`.
1. Under `node`, check the boxes for `id` and `createdAt`.
    * `createdAt` could help you identity the payment ID you're searching for if you know when the payment was initiated.
    * You might choose to get only the `first` 10 IDs on the list, use [pagination](../../../developers/using-api/pagination.mdx) to filter further, or add a `totalCount`.
