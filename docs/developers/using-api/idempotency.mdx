# Idempotency

Idempotency ensures that API operations execute only once, even if you retry the same request multiple times.
This prevents duplicate transactions caused by network issues, system interruptions, or request timeouts.

## How it works

When you include an `idempotencyKey` in a supported mutation:

1. **First request**: Swan generates a unique identifier, executes the operation, and stores the result with your key.
2. **Subsequent requests**: Swan checks for existing operations and returns the current state instead of creating a new one.
3. **Key expiration**: After 24 hours, the same key can be reused for a new operation.

## Supported operations

Idempotency is available for operations that create resources or have side effects, including:

- [`initiateCreditTransfers`](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/guide-initiate-ct/) to prevent duplicate payments.
- Additional mutations will support idempotency in future updates.

## Idempotency key requirements

Your `idempotencyKey` must be:

- **A unique string**: UUID v4 recommended (e.g., `156d000c-4b32-4e83-aa36-277f2c9b6290`).
- **Maximum 255 characters**.
- **Alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only**.
- **Scoped to your authentication context**: Keys are isolated by project and user, ensuring the same key used by different projects or users will not conflict.

## Example usage

```graphql
mutation ExampleWithIdempotency {
  initiateCreditTransfers(
    input: {
      idempotencyKey: "156d000c-4b32-4e83-aa36-277f2c9b6290"
      accountId: "$YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
      consentRedirectUrl: "$YOUR_REDIRECT_URL"
      creditTransfers: {
        amount: { value: "100", currency: "EUR" }
        sepaBeneficiary: {
          iban: "IT23P0300203280632123553748"
          name: "Francesca Verrilli"
          isMyOwnIban: false
          save: false
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    ... on InitiateCreditTransfersSuccessPayload {
      payment {
        id
        statusInfo {
          ... on PaymentConsentPending {
            consent {
              consentUrl
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Response behavior

### First request
Returns the operation result and stores it with your idempotency key.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "initiateCreditTransfers": {
      "payment": {
        "id": "cto_6b0b973e9c71de540776e300494be5fa",
        "statusInfo": {
          "__typename": "PaymentConsentPending",
          "consent": {
            "consentUrl": "https://identity.swan.io/consent?consentId=949872ab...",
            "id": "949872ab-0c11-46b0-89d0-bc16c02db220"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Subsequent requests
Returns the **current state** of the original operation. If the payment status has changed (e.g., user provided consent), the response reflects this.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "initiateCreditTransfers": {
      "payment": {
        "id": "cto_6b0b973e9c71de540776e300494be5fa",
        "statusInfo": {
          "__typename": "PaymentInitiated",
          "status": "Initiated"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Error handling

Swan handles idempotency differently based on when errors occur.

### Validation errors (before execution)
Requests that fail parameter validation (e.g., invalid IBAN format) never reach execution, so no idempotent result is stored.
You can safely retry these requests with the same key after fixing the validation issues.

### Business logic errors (during execution)  
Requests that pass validation but fail during execution (e.g., insufficient funds) store the error result with the idempotency key.
Subsequent requests with the same key return the identical error, even if conditions have changed.

For example, if a payment fails due to insufficient funds, retrying with the same idempotency key returns the same error even after the account is funded.

## Best practices

- **Generate unique keys**: Use UUID v4 or similar for each distinct operation.
- **Store keys locally**: Keep track of idempotency keys for operations you might need to retry.
- **Handle current state**: Your application should handle responses that reflect the current state, not just the initial state.
- **Use for critical operations**: Always include idempotency keys for payment initiation and other critical operations.

## Key expiration

Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours. After expiration:
- The same key can be reused for a new operation.
- Previous results are no longer accessible when using that key.
- This prevents indefinite storage of operation results.
