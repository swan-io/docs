## New features

üìñ Get a head start on what's next. We've added a [**Preview** section](https://docs.swan.io/preview/) to our documentation, giving you early access to our features. Use these previews to plan your future roadmap. Note that functionality may change before the official release.

## Improvements

‚èπÔ∏è You can now [cancel merchant SEPA Direct Debit payments](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/#canceling) using the `cancelMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Refer to the `availableToCancel` balance to check if a specific payment can be canceled.

üîç Use the `isCancelable` field to verify whether scheduled account funding transactions are eligible for [cancellation](/topics/accounts/funding/#canceling).

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

üîÑ Starting **October 1st**, we're removing the `paymentId` field from the `initiateSepaDirectDebitMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Instead, retrieve the ID from the `merchantPayment` field, which now returns the Merchant Payment object.
We're also deprecating the `paymentId` field.

‚öñÔ∏è Starting **October 31st**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be a mandatory field at onboarding when an account holder's residency country does not match the `accountCountry`. This is to comply with [CRS (Common Reporting Standard) regulations](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf).
For example, Spanish residents opening French accounts will need to provide their tax identification number.
