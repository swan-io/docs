## New features

💳 [**Payment Control**](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/payment-control/) now allows the reception of 0€ authorizations and credit authorizations, identifiable with `TransactionSide!` as `Credit`. Activate this feature from your **Dashboard** > **Developers** > **Payment control**.

🔑 **Idempotency** is now available for `initiateCreditTransfers`. Systematically add an [idempotency key](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/idempotency/#idempotency-key-requirements) to your transfer queries to improve the reliability of your integration and prevent duplicate transactions.

📥 You can now [export transaction data](/topics/payments/overview/guide-export-transactions/) in `.csv` format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportTransactionData` mutation.

## Improvements

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 [**Server-to-server consent**](https://docs.swan.io/topics/users/consent/#s2s) is now available for all **account membership [mutations](https://docs.swan.io/topics/users/consent/#sensitive)**, to enable you to reduce manual operations and scale more easily.

🔢 A new `Service` section has been added to your **Dashboard** > **Insights**, to provide you with data on KYC and Transaction Monitoring volumes and SLAs. Some of this data was originally in the `Onboarding` section and have been migrated to `Service`.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ Here's my upcoming breaking change.

### Reminders
