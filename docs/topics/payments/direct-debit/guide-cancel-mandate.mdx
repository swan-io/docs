# Cancel a payment mandate

Cancel SEPA Direct Debit received payment mandates with the API.

[From old doc](https://docs.swan.io/concept/payment/direct-debit#cancellation-of-a-received-sepa-direct-debit-mandate):

- A received SEPA direct debit mandate is automatically switched to the Canceled status by Swan when the value of the sequence field of the received SEPA direct debit mandate is OneOff and when one SEPA direct debit transaction has already been received for the concerned account (whatever it's status).
- When a SEPA direct debit instruction is received (therefore before the debit date/at reception), it is automatically switched to Rejected status by Swan when the underlying received SEPA direct debit mandate has Canceled status
