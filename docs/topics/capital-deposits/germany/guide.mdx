# ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Deposit capital in Germany

Depositing share capital in Germany is a multi-step process involving Swan, you, and your end user (referred to as *shareholder* on this page).

:::tip Responsibilities
- **You** and **your shareholder** are responsible for completing steps 1-2, 4, and 6-9.
- The shareholder must complete step 6 themselves.
- Swan completes steps 3 and 5.
:::

## Step 1: Onboard company account holder {#onboard-company-account}

Shareholders for German capital deposit cases need a company account.
To onboard a new shareholder, create a company account onboarding link for them.

1. [Create the onboarding link](../../onboarding/company/guide-create.mdx). The guide includes instructions for the API and your Dashboard.
1. Provide all information required for Germany, as detailed on the [company onboarding](../../onboarding/company/index.mdx#country-reqs) homepage.
    - You can provide this information when creating the link.
    - Shareholders can fill in this information on the onboarding form.
1. Finalize the onboarding.
    - You can use the API to [finalize all account onboardings](../../onboarding/overview/guide-finalize.mdx) after each shareholder has at least opened their onboarding link.
    - Shareholders can also finalize their own onboardings with the onboarding form.

:::warning Handelsregister & Registernummer
- **Choose no** when asked if you're registered with *Handelsregister*.
- **Leave it blank** when asked to provide your registration number *Registernummer*.
:::

## Step 2: Complete identification {#identification}

Your shareholders must [complete identification](../../users/identifications/index.mdx), proving their identities to Swan.

- If you use Swan's onboarding form, your users are redirected automatically.
- If you created your own onboarding flow, make sure your users are redirected.

Please note that [account holder verification status](../../onboarding/account-holders/index.mdx#verification-process) can't move to `Pending` until identification is complete, which is required for Swan to review the capital deposit case.

## Step 3: Swan receives capital deposit case {#receive-case}

Leaving the registration number *Registernummer* blank notifies Swan of the new capital deposit case in Germany.

<mark>what else? do we actually need this as a step?</mark>

## Step 4: Upload capital deposit documents {#upload-documents-1}

You or your shareholder receives a request from Swan to provide two documents:

1. Dokument zur Neueintrag ins Handelsregister (Document for new entry into the commercial register)
1. Satzung *or* Gesellschaftsvertrag (Statutes *or* Articles of Association)

Provide Swan with these documents using any of the following methods:

- method
- method
- method

## Step 5: Swan sends main IBAN {#iban}

After receiving the documents requested in step 4, Swan provides the shareholder with their account's [main IBAN](../../accounts/ibans/index.mdx#main).

:::note Account type
At this stage, the new account's [account type](../../accounts/index.mdx#account-type-level) is still `EMoney`, and IBANs aren't usually shared until the account type changes to `PaymentService`.
Therefore, the IBAN is shared early, an exception only made for German capital deposit cases.
:::

## Step 6: Transfer capital funds {#transfer-capital-funds}

Each shareholder must transfer their capital share deposit from an **account in their name** to their new Swan account, using the IBAN received in step 5.

Shareholders must **perform this transfer themselves**.

## Step 7: Get account statement {#account-statement}

After transferring their capital share deposit, shareholders need to get an [account statement](../../accounts/index.mdx#account-documents).
It's best to use the **default settings** for the account statement.
Generating a custom statement requires additional approval from Swan.

- You can provide the statement to the shareholder:
    - [Generate an account statement](../../accounts/overview/guide-generate-statement.mdx) with the API.
    - [Get the account statement](../../accounts/overview/guide-generate-statement.mdx#dashboard) from your Dashboard.
- If you use Swan's Web Banking, shareholders can [download the statement](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/16649688848925-Downloading-your-account-statement) from their Web Banking app.

## Step 8: Upload final required document {#upload-documents-2}

Swan requires one additional document:

1. Auszug des Unternehmensregisters *or* Handelsregister *or* Transparenzregisters (Proof of Registration)

Provide Swan with this document using any of the following methods:

- method
- method
- method

:::info Account holder verification
If steps 1-8 are completed successfully and the documents are approved by Swan, the shareholder's [account holder verification status](../../onboarding/account-holders/index.mdx#verification-process) changes to `Verified`.
:::

## Step 9: Provide Tax IDs {#request-tax-ids}

Within 90 days of account holder verification, provide the following Tax IDs:

- Company
- Account's legal representativeâˆ—
- All ultimate beneficial owners (UBO)âˆ—

âˆ— *Note that UBOs and the legal representative might have provided their Tax IDs during onboarding.*

Swan sends a reminder **every 30 days**.
If the Tax IDs aren't provided, the [company account is `Suspended`](../../accounts/index.mdx#statuses).

If there is any confusion about why the Tax ID is required, please send your users the Swan Support Center article about [German Tax Identification numbers](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/21876111550621-German-Tax-identification-number-Tax-ID).

:::success Congratulations
After providing required Tax IDs, the capital deposit process is complete.
**Best of luck with your endeavor!**
