Rolling reserve is a policy Swan applies to merchant transactions to **protect the merchant and Swan** against various risk factors, primarily insufficient funds and attempted fraud.
The reserved amount acts as a safety net to cover potential loss for both Swan and the merchant.

Rolling reserve is expressed as a **percentage over a period of time** (example: 10% of the payment amount over 30 business days), and applies to most payment methods used by merchants to accept payments with Swan.

For the indicated period of time, the amount isn't part of the merchant's [available account balance](https://docs.swan.io/concept/account/balances), after which the funds are released to the merchant and can be used.

Rolling reserve is held in a non-interest bearing reserve for transparency between Swan and merchants, therefore reducing the risk of a conflict of interest between the two parties.
