## Individual onboarding form {#onboarding-form}

Through the individual onboarding form, Swan collects the following information:

1. User's **email address**.
1. User's **country of residence** and **residence address**.
1. Basic details about the **user's employment** and **financial situation**. This information allows Swan to perform two essential tasks:
    * During onboarding, Swan completes an identity analysis (Know Your Customer, or KYC).
    * For the lifetime of the account, Swan monitors for fraud.
1. User [**signs up**](../../users/index.mdx#signup) for Swan.

## Identification recommendations {#identification-recommendations}

Swan must verify the identity of every user.
Swan supports multiple [identification processes](../../users/identifications/index.mdx#levels-processes).
