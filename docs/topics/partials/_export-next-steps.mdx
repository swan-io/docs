After you finalize your export, whether from your Dashboard or using the API, a link to download the export is **sent to you by email**.
You must be **logged in** to download the `.csv` export file.

Download links are **valid for seven days**, after which you need to generate a new export.

:::warning Sharing the download link
If you forward someone the email with the download link, they can only use it if they also have access to the Dashboard.
Otherwise, an error occurs.

Instead, consider downloading the document and sending it to them.
