### New features

📥 **Provide transaction [supporting documents](/topics/accounts/documents/) with the API**.
Build your own communication flow between you and your users to request documents justifying a transaction ID, then submit the requested documents to Swan with the API.
Also, you can subscribe to the `SupportingDocumentCollection.Updated` webhook to learn when a document is requested by Swan for a transaction ID.
If you choose not to implement the API feature, you'll continue to use the current email process.

📨 **[Proactively share supporting documents](/topics/accounts/documents/guide-upload-transaction) when initiating an transaction with the API**.
To bypass potential requests for supporting documents, you can attach a supporting document to a transaction proactively when initiating the transaction with the API.
In that case, if a document is required at a later stage, Swan won't need to contact the user to provide it.

### Breaking change

ℹ️ As announced on [November 30](/changelog/30-november-2023/) and [July 19](/changelog/19-july-2024/), we removed the `user` > `identificationStatus`.
Instead, use the `identificationLevels` booleans.

### Upcoming breaking changes

📃 In **4 weeks**, we're adding a new value to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum: `CompanyFormationRegistration`.
