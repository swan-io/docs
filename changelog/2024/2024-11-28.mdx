## New features

👥 Invite account members without a phone number for certain membership permissions.
Instead, [use verified email to invite account members](/topics/accounts/memberships/#invite) who prefer not to use their personal phone number for professional purposes.

🪪 We added a [new identification level for authorization links](/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user/#url-parameters-optional), `Auto`. 
With `Auto`, Swan automatically guides users to the correct identification process for their situation.
We recommend choosing `Auto` instead of a specific process when constructing your OAuth URLs.

## Improvements

💳 We improved **transaction visibility for cardholders** without the `canViewAccount` membership permission.
They can now [view their own card transactions](/topics/accounts/memberships/#permissions-cards).

👥 We improved account membership visibility for account members who have the `canManageAccountMembership` membership permission, but not `canViewAccount`.
They can now [view a list of account members](/topics/accounts/memberships/#permissions).

🌐 Finnish is now a supported [account language](/topics/accounts/#language-list) and [account membership language](/topics/accounts/memberships/#language), with a few exceptions.
You can update the account language with the `updateAccount` mutation, and the account membership language with the `updateAccountMembership` mutation.

🔎 Starting on **December 2nd**, API search queries will allow for similarity and full-text search.
They won't be sensitive to case or accents anymore. This update only applies to search, not other filters.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🧭 On **January 8th**, we're adding three new values to the [`DocumentReasonCode` Enum](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/document-reason-code/) to handle more reasons for capital deposit document refusal: `ComplianceReason`, `InvalidDepositBankName`, and `MissingCompanyProviderRegisterExtract`.

🚫 On **January 20th**, we’re removing the following deprecated fields:  `accountMemberships.firstName`,  `accountMemberships.lastName`, `accountMemberships.email`,  `accountHolders.firstName`, `accountHolders.lastName`, `onboardings.email`, `users.firstName`, and `users.lastName`.

🌍 On **January 30th**, `accountCountry` will become a mandatory input for the following mutations: `onboardCompanyAccountHolder`, `onboardIndividualAccountHolder`, and `createCapitalDepositCase`.

🪪 Starting on **January 30th**, the [`idVerified` scope in authorization URL parameters](/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user#code-construct-url) won't be supported anymore.
Instead, use the [`identificationLevel` parameter](/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user#url-parameters-optional).
