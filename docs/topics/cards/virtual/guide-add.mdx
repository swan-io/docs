# Add virtual cards

You can add one or multiple virtual cards, as well as single-use virtual cards.
After adding a virtual card, you can update that card, view sensitive card information, and cancel or deactivate the card.

:::tip Prerequisites
You need to add [account memberships](../../accounts/memberships/index.mdx) before creating cards.
Follow the guides to add [one membership](../../accounts/memberships/guide-add-one.mdx) or [multiple memberships](../../accounts/memberships/guide-add-multiple.mdx).
:::

## Add a virtual card {#add-one}

Add a new card for an existing account member by calling the `addCard` mutation.
This mutation can only be called on behalf of an account member with the `canManageAccountMembership` rights.
When you do this, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token in the name of the account member.

The new card is thus created with the `ConsentPending` status.
A `consentUrl` is returned which invites the user to start Strong Customer Authentication with Swan. 
After the user completes the Strong Customer Authentication process, the new card changes to `Activated` status.

In the mutation, you can use `cardProductId` field (optional) to choose which card design the user will receive.
If don't use this field, they'll receive your default card product design.

:::info Users can add virtual cards
Users with `CanManageCards` permission can add their own virtual card directly from Swan's Web Banking interface, and they can use the virtual card immediately.

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Add multiple virtual cards {#add-multiple}

Add multiple cards to different existing account members by calling the `addCards` mutation.
It works nearly the same way as `addCard` with two additional features:

1. Add the physical card at the same time you add the virtual card by using the `physicalCard` field in the `addCards` mutation, plus entering a delivery address.
1. Configure the spending limit when adding the card with the `spendingLimit` field in the `addCards` mutation.

The new card is thus created with the `ConsentPending` status.
A `consentUrl` is returned which invites the user to start Strong Customer Authentication with Swan. 
After the user completes the Strong Customer Authentication process, the new card changes to `Processing` status.

The cards are created asynchronously and then change to the `Enabled` status.

Depending on how many cards you're creating, it can take up to several minutes to complete the process.
For performance reasons, you can create up to **250 cards** per API call.

## Print physical cards when adding virtual cards {#print-with-virtual}

Please refer to the guides in the **physical cards section** to learn more about creating virtual and physical cards at the same time.
These guides cover settings, spending limits, and allowing your card holders to choose their own PIN.

- [Print a physical card when adding a virtual card](../physical/guide-print.mdx#print-with-virtual)
- [Print multiple physical cards with group delivery](../physical/guide-print.mdx#print-group)

## Add single-use virtual cards {#add-suv}

Add new single-use virtual cards to an existing account member by calling the `addSingleUseVirtualCard` mutation.

This mutation can be called on behalf of any account member with the permission `canManageCards`.
The permission `canManageAccountMembership` is optional.
Learn more about [permissions and card management](../../accounts/memberships/index.mdx#permissions-cards).

When you do this, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token using the name of the card's account member.
The new card is thus created with the `ConsentPending` status and a `consentUrl` is returned which invites the user to start the Strong Customer Authentication with Swan.
After the user completes the Strong Customer Authentication process, the new card changes to `Enabled` status.

The Single Use Virtual Card is never renewed.
It cannot be physically printed, and it can't be added to digital Wallets (Apple or Google).

:::info Single-use virtual cards & server-to-server consent
If you want to issue single-use virtual cards without having direct human interaction to consent and reveal card numbers, you must be the account holder (not available for end-users) and have [server-to-server consent](../../users/consent/guide-implement-s2s.mdx) implemented.

For both the single-use virtual card mutations (`addSingleUseVirtualCard` and `addSingleUseVirtualCards`), the `SuccessForProjectOwnerPayload` will return a card in `ConsentPending` status.
The status changes to `Enabled` after the consent is validated.
It's recommended to verify the card status before using it.
