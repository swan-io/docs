# Close an account

You might need to close a Swan account for several reasons.

:::tip Different closure processes
The account closure process depends on who is closing the account.

1. **You or a legal representative**: Your guides are on this page.
1. **Swan or a third party**: Refer to the [explanatory content](../index.mdx#closure) about account closures when requested by a third party, such as a notary or a liquidator, or decided by Swan.
1. **Account holder**: Swan's end-user [Support Center](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/14642306196765-Account-closure-process) documents the process for your users.
:::

:::info Limited or Unlimited
As a Swan Partner, your process depends on the account's payment level: `Limited` or `Unlimited`.
You can find the payment level by going to **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Accounts**, then clicking the account you're trying to close.
The payment level is part of the account's general information.
:::

## Close a `Limited` account {#limited}

### Step 1: Submit closure request {#limited-submit}

import SubmitClosureRequestLimited from './partials/_partner-close-account.mdx';

<SubmitClosureRequestLimited />

### Step 2: Swan reviews request {#limited-review}

For `Limited` accounts, consent from the account holder isn't required.
Therefore, Swan proceeds with account closure without contacting the account holder.

Before changing the account status to `Closing`, Swan confirms several details:

1. If the **account status** is `Suspended`, the account holder is already communicating with Swan about the suspension. The same Swan team takes over account closure.
1. If the account balance is **positive**, or if **transactions** have already been made from the account, Swan follows the process to close an `Unlimited` account instead.
1. If the account balance is **negative**, Swan can't close the account.

### Step 3: Swan changes account status {#limited-status}

If the process to close the account doesn't need to change based on details confirmed in step 2, Swan changes the account status to `Closing`.

Since the account was never used, passing from `Closing` to `Closed` happens quickly; there isn't a required notice period.

## Close an `Unlimited` account {#unlimited}

### Step 1: Submit closure request {#unlimited-submit}

import SubmitClosureRequestUnlimited from './partials/_partner-close-account.mdx';

<SubmitClosureRequestUnlimited />
4. Additionally, make sure to tell Swan *when* you'd like the account to close.
There are **three options**, explained in the following table.

| Option | Explanation | Requirements |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Account closed in 60 days | *None* |
| 2 | Account closed on a specific date more than 60 days in the future | Share the specific date with Swan |
| 3 | Account closed on a specific date within fewer than 60 days | Provide signed document with consent from account holder (contractual evidence) |

5. If you choose option 3, **send Swan the contractual evidence**.
    - Contractual evidence is a document signed by the account holder stating that they agree to close their Swan account on the specific date.
    - The document is required by law to close an account within fewer than 60 days.

### Step 2: Swan reviews request {#unlimited-review}

Before notifying the account holder of their upcoming account closure, Swan confirms several details:

1. If the **account status** is `Suspended`, the account holder is already communicating with Swan about the suspension. The same Swan team takes over account closure.
1. If the account balance is **negative**, Swan asks the account holder to transfer funds to their account so the balance reaches zero.

### Step 3: Swan initiates account closure {#unlimited-initiate}

After reviewing the request, Swan initiates the actual account closure.

1. **Swan emails the account holder** informing them that their account will be closed.
    - The email specifies whether the account will close in two months or on a specific date, based on the option you selected in step 1.
    - Swan must send the email. It's generic and straightforward for all account holders.
1. Swan **changes the account status** to `Closing` after two months or on the specific date.
1. The account **undergoes the closing process**. Refer to the [account statuses](../index.mdx#statuses) section for an overview of what happens while an account is `Closing`.
1. After the account status changes to `Closed`, Swan **sends a final email** to the account holder informing them that their account is officially closed.

## Close an account by legal representative request {#legal-rep}

If the account holder's [legal representative](../../../glossary.mdx#legal-representative) requests an account closure, the process **starts with the API**.

1. Call the `closeAccount` mutation with the legal representative's [user access token](../../authentication/index.mdx#tokens-user).
1. The API returns a `consentUrl`.
1. Send the `consentUrl` to your user so they can complete [Strong Customer Authentication](../../consent/index.mdx#sca).
1. As soon as the user consents, the account status changes to `Closing`.

Refer to the [account statuses](../index.mdx#statuses) section for an overview of what happens while an account is `Closing`.
