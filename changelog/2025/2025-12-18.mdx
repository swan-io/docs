## New features

🧭 We're releasing a [preview of the documentation](/preview/new-onboarding) for our new onboarding API. Built to strengthen risk assessment and regulatory compliance through improved data collection, it also delivers a [better developer experience](/preview/new-onboarding/#whats-changing) with cleaner mutations and queries, structured inputs, and typed responses. Full launch is planned for **[Q1 2026](/preview/#preview)**.

## Improvements

📈 The **Insights** tab on your Dashboard now includes new visualizations:

- **Capital deposits**: New data improving visibility on iteration time for internal reviews.
- **Support**: New dedicated section tracking support tickets, categorization, and SLAs.

## Important update

📩 Following an incident during activation of the [new white-labelled email notifications](/changelog/4-december-2025#improvements) announced on December 4, we rolled back to the previous account opening notifications within an hour. The December 18 breaking change for account membership invitations is also postponed.

We plan to activate all new white-labelled notifications in **January 2026** with two weeks' notice. You'll be able to test them in Production Sandbox beforehand.

Affected notifications:
- Your account terms and conditions.
- First transfer.
- Request supporting documents.
- Request supporting documents reminders.
- Your account is opened.
- Join your banking space.
