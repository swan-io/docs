# Closing accounts

A Swan account might need to be closed for several reasons.
**You**, your **account holders**, **Swan**, and **third parties** can all request an account be closed.

:::note Payment for accounts in closing
You only pay for accounts with the status `Opened`.
As soon as an account enters the closure process, the status changes to `Closing` and you're no longer charged for the account.

## Swan closing accounts {#closure-swan}

Swan reserves the right to close accounts, and might decide to close an account for the following reasons:

1. The account holder's identity document looks fake, stolen, or altered; the device used to complete an identification is altered; or the applicant seems to have performed their identification against their will.
1. Suspicion of other fraudulent activity or activities that aren't compliant with Swan's policies.
1. The onboarding, identification, or Know Your Customer (KYC) process wasn't completed.
1. The Partner (you) is no longer working with Swan.

When closing accounts, Swan is required by law to provide a  **two-month notice** period.
More specifically, Swan waits 60 days after notifying the account holder to change the account status to `Closing`.
This provides the account holder with enough time to open an account at another financial institution before losing access to their Swan account.

Swan **can close accounts immediately** if the closure is due to fraud or a third-party request.

## Closure requested by a third party {#closure-third-party}

Swan can receive requests from third parties to close accounts.
For example, **liquidators** can request account closure if the account holder's company is being liquidated.
Additionally, **notaries** can request account closure in the case of the account holder's death.

Before accepting requests from third parties, Swan performs the following actions:

1. Swan confirms the request is **legitimate**. If the request is fraudulent, Swan doesn't comply.
1. Swan **checks the account balance**.
    - Zero balance: No action required.
    - Positive balance: Swan requests bank details from the third party, then transfers the funds.
    - Negative balance: Swan requests the third party transfer funds so the balance reaches zero.

When the account balance reaches zero, Swan changes the account status to `Closed` immediately for legitimate third-party requests.
