### Improvements

📃 It's now possible to [simulate a supporting document request](/topics/onboarding/documents/sandbox#simulate-document-request) in Sandbox.

📅 We've improved the account holder queries with `verificationStatusInfo`, allowing you to get the exact date when a verification status was updated.

🔚 [Shareholder accounts](/topics/capital-deposits/#shareholders) are now set to `Closing` upon completion of the capital deposit case.
First, we will use `CloseAccountReasonType` = `ComplianceReason`.
In **4 weeks**, we will use the new value `CapitalDepositReason`.

### Breaking changes

⚠️ The Ultimate Beneficial Owner's (UBO) residency country is now mandatory in our **no-code onboarding form**.
