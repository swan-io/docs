## Improvements

🧭 Account statement documents now follow a new, more readable naming convention that includes the document language. The new format is: 
`AccountStatement_[ProjectName]_[AccountNumber]_[period]_[documentLanguage]`.

👫 Account member invitations with a `ConsentPending` [status](/topics/accounts/memberships/#statuses) will now expire if the inviter does not provide consent before the consent period ends. This automatically changes the account membership status to `Disabled`, allowing you to inform the user to send a new invitation.
- When querying `AccountMembershipDisabledStatusInfo`, you'll see the reason `InvitationExpired`.
- If you're subscribed to the `AccountMembership.Updated` webhook, you'll receive a notification when the membership is `Disabled`.

✍️ You can now use [`checkMerchantPayment`](/topics/merchants/online/checks/guide-initiate) to track the [statuses](/topics/merchants/online/checks/#payments-statuses) and [balances](/topics/merchants/online/checks/#payments-balances) of French check payments. 
As a result, we're deprecating the `merchantPayment` field on `InitiateCheckMerchantPaymentSuccessPayload`, use `checkMerchantPayment` instead.

## API updates
