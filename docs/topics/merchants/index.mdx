## Overview {#overview}

Merchants are account holders who want to accept payments by card, SEPA Direct Debit, Internal Direct Debit, or French checks, either directly from a payment link or an invoice. 
This includes contractors, healthcare professionals, artisans, and business owners, among others.

With a merchant profile and at least one active merchant payment method, you can help your merchants accept payments with Swan.

:::info Pending review
Before accepting payments, you need to complete a risk review.
To get started, contact your dedicated Technical Account Manager, or send an email to integration@swan.io.
:::

### Managing risk {#risk}

Accepting payments from customers comes with risk, and Swan prioritizes a **risk-based approach**.

Swan reviews all requests for merchant profiles, profile updates, and payment methods. 
Both profiles and payment methods initially start with the status `PendingReview`.

For payment methods, Swan may change the status to `WaitingForInformation` when additional details are needed. 
In such cases, you'll receive these details within the `verificationRequirements` list. New information must be provided at the Merchant Profile level.

To manage potential risk, if suspicious activity is detected, Swan can **change the status** of both **profiles and payment methods** to `Suspended` or `Rejected`.
Swan can also reinstate a profile or payment method by changing the status to `Enabled`.
Finally, if Swan assigns the status `Rejected` to a profile or payment method, the decision is final and can't be reversed. 
The user must submit a new request for the account holder, which Swan will review as a separate submission.

### Webhooks {#webhooks}

Subscribe to numerous webhooks to facilitate your merchant integrations.
Review the [full list of merchant webhooks](../../developers/using-api/webhooks.mdx#events-merchants), or subscribe to them directly from your **Dashboard** > **Developers** > **Webhooks**.

## Merchant profiles {#profiles}

A **merchant profile** is a collection of business, risk, and support information that fulfills two primary requirements: 

1. **Approve the account holder** as a merchant.
1. **Facilitate accepting payments** with Swan. 

If a Swan account holder wants to accept payments from customers, they must have at least one merchant profile.

Your users can create merchant profiles during onboarding, but only if you've requested the feature for the account holder.
Since merchants are considered high risk, merchant profiles should only be requested for account holders who qualify and will accept payments.
Requesting merchant profiles for account holders that don't qualify may create false expectations about available features.

To speed up **merchant profile enablement**, complete as many input fields as possible. A merchant profile contains the following information:

<FieldRequirementsLegend />

| Field | Requirement | Description |
| :---: | :---: | --- |
| **Business details** | <Req /> | Merchant's legal name and product type (`Goods`, `Services`, `VirtualGoods`, or `GiftAndDonations`). |
| **Projected volumes** | <Req /> | Expected monthly payment volume and average order value, used to assess the business size and risk. |
| **Link to the merchant's website or social network** | <Cnd /> | **Recommended**. Provides context on the merchant's activity and may be requested during the review. May be requested after a risk review if it wasn't provided before. |
| **Payment frequency** | <Cnd /> | Defines whether payments are mainly one-off or recurring (e.g. subscriptions). |
| **Logo** | <Opt /> | A `.png` file under 1 MB, displayed on the payment page and the mandate PDF. |
| **Accent color** | <Opt /> | Hex code used to customize the payment page design and mandate. |
| **Customer region** | <Cnd /> | Country or region where the merchant expects to receive payments. |
| **Additional information** | <Cnd /> | Required only if custom information is needed. Specified in the `expectedMerchantProfileAdditionalInformation` field of the `ProjectInfo` object in the API. |
| **Supporting documents** | <Cnd /> | Required only after a payment method risk review. Listed in the `paymentMethod` object in the API. |

The merchant profile is created with the status `PendingReview`, and is visible right away on your Dashboard.

| Profile status | Explanation |
|:---:|---|
| `PendingReview` | The profile is under review by Swan. <br /><br />• If the profile doesn't meet our requirements or we consider it a risk, we'll change the status to `Rejected`. Otherwise, we'll change the status to `Enabled`. <br />• Request payment methods while a profile is `PendingReview`. |
| `Enabled` | The profile is active.<br /><br />• Use `Enabled` profiles to request payment methods and accept payments with activated payment methods.<br />• Updates to profiles can only occur when they are `Enabled`. |
| `Suspended` | **Swan** assigns this status when we need to review a merchant's profile. The profile can't be `Enabled` again until we complete our review. |
| `Rejected` | **Swan** assigns this **final status** when a profile's risk is too high, or for other risk-related reasons. |
| `Disabled` | **You** set this final status using the `disableMerchantProfile` mutation. |

### Updating merchant profiles {#profiles-update}

You can [request a merchant profile update](./profiles/guide-update.mdx) with the API mutation `requestMerchantProfileUpdate`.
If you use Swan's Web Banking interface, merchants can request an update through their app.
Request an update for the merchant's name, website, product type, expected monthly payment volume, expected average basket, and logo.

Updating a merchant profile produces the following events:

1. The [**merchant profile status**](#statuses) doesn't change, remaining `Enabled`. The merchant continues to use their merchant profile with the existing information.
1. The **update status** is `PendingReview`. Swan reviews the new information to ensure it meets requirements. 
1. After Swan reviews and validates the update request, the update status changes to `Enabled` and the update is published to the merchant profile.
1. If Swan rejects the update request, the merchant profile remains `Enabled` by default, unless Swan decides otherwise. 
The merchant profile status doesn't change.

When a merchant payment method is requested, Swan may ask for additional information even if the merchant profile is already `Enabled`.
Swan will contact you or your user directly, based on your communication preferences.

If you requested an update and your update status is `PendingReview`, but you need to **make another change**, submit a new update request.
Swan reviews both requests, but only the most recent is made public. 

:::caution Subject to review
All update requests are reviewed by Swan according to the same [risk guidelines](#risk) as a new merchant profile.
:::

### Merchant profile rejection {#profile-rejected}

The merchant profile is created with the status `PendingReview`, and is visible right away on your Dashboard. 
It is then updated to either `Enabled` or `Rejected` depending on Swan's risk review.

A merchant profile can be rejected for the following reasons:

| Rejection reason | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `DuplicateProfile` | The profile is the same as an existing one. |
| `InconsistentOrMissingInformation` | Key information is missing or highly inconsistent, for example, an unrelated website. |
| `UnsupportedActivity` | The activity is prohibited or the NACE code isn't supported. |
| `ContractualCriteriaNotFulfilled` | The profile doesn't meet specific criteria agreed upon with Partners. |
| `GenericRejection` | The profile was rejected for a general reason not covered by other categories. |
| `SuspiciousBehavior` | The profile was rejected due to alerts related to suspicious processing behavior. |


## Payment methods {#methods}

Your merchants can accept customer payments using several payment methods.

Merchant payment methods are connected to a merchant profile, and a single merchant profile can have multiple payment methods.
To accept payments with Swan, there must be an `Enabled` merchant profile and at least one `Enabled` merchant payment method.

To learn how to request payment methods, refer to the request payment method guides for [card payments](./online/cards/guide-request.mdx), [SEPA Direct Debit](./online/sdd/guide-request.mdx), [Internal Direct Debit](./online/idd/guide-request.mdx), and [French checks](./online/checks/guide-request.mdx).
You can request multiple methods in one API call.

### Available payment methods {#methods-options}

import OnlinePaymentMethods from './partials/_online-list.mdx';

<OnlinePaymentMethods />

All merchant payment method requests are subject to a risk review and start with the status `PendingReview`. 
As part of this process, Swan may need to request additional information from the merchant to complete the assessment.

| Payment method status | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `PendingReview` | The payment method is under review by Swan. <br /><br />• If the request doesn't meet our requirements or we consider it a risk, we'll change the status to `Rejected`.<br />• Otherwise, we'll change the status to `Enabled`.|
| `WaitingForInformation` | More information is needed before the payment method can be reviewed by Swan.<br /><br />• The `verificationRequirements` shows what the Partner must provide to trigger a new review.<br />• Submit supporting documents and request a new review using the `requestSupportingDocumentCollectionReview` mutation.<br />• After all required information is submitted, the status returns to `PendingReview` for a new review. |
| `Enabled` | The payment method is active.<br /><br />• Use `Enabled` payment methods to accept payments.<br />• Updates to payment methods can only occur when they are `Enabled`. |
| `Suspended` | **Swan** assigns this status when we need to review the merchant's use of their payment method. The payment method can't be `Enabled` again until we complete our review. |
| `Rejected` | **Swan** assigns this **final status** when a payment method's risk is too high, or for other risk-related reasons. |
| `Disabled` | **You** set this final status using the `disableMerchantPaymentMethod` mutation. |

### Payment method rejection {#payment-method-rejected}

A merchant payment method can be rejected for the following reasons:

| Rejection reason | Explanation |
|------------------|-------------|
| `InvalidUseCase` | The requested payment method is incompatible with the merchant's business model. |
| `InconsistentOrMissingInformation` | The merchant didn't provide, or refused to provide, requested information. |
| `UnsupportedPaymentMethod` | The Partner isn't allowed to request this payment method. |
| `ContractualCriteriaNotFulfilled` | The request doesn't meet the contractual criterion agreed upon with the Partner. |
| `GenericRejection` | The request was rejected for a reason not covered by other categories. |

### Rolling reserve {#rolling-reserve}

import RollingReserve from './partials/_rolling-reserve.mdx';

<RollingReserve />

| Payment method | Rolling reserve | Default amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cards | <Yes /> **Yes** | 100% over 5 business days |
| SEPA Direct Debit - Core | <Yes /> **Yes** | Determined by a merchant profile risk assessment |
| SEPA Direct Debit - B2B | <Yes /> **Yes** | 100% over 3 business days |
| Internal Direct Debit - Standard | <Yes /> **Yes** | Determined by a merchant profile risk assessment |
| Internal Direct Debit - B2B | <No /> No | n/a |
| French checks | <Yes /> **Yes** | 100% over 10 interbank business days |

:::

### Versions {#methods-versions-statuses}

Swan creates a **new version** of your payment method **every time an update is approved**.
Only one version of a payment method can have the status `Enabled`.

Swan manages the statuses for `Enabled` or `PendingReview` payment methods automatically.
Therefore, you don't need to change the status before calling the API.
