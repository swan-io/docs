## New features

🧭 We're releasing a [preview of the documentation](/preview/new-onboarding) for our new onboarding API. Built to strengthen risk assessment and regulatory compliance through improved data collection, it also delivers a better developer experience with cleaner mutations and queries, structured inputs, and typed responses. Full launch is planned for **Q1 2026**.

## Improvements

📈 The **Insights** tab on your Dashboard now includes new visualizations for capital deposits and Support lead times:

- **Capital deposits**: New data improving visibility on iteration time for internal reviews.
- **Support**: New dedicated section tracking support tickets, categorization, and SLAs.
