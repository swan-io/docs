# Activate physical cards

Activate physical cards by either:

1. Entering the PIN when making your first payment, or
1. Calling the `activatePhysicalCard` mutation which returns a consent. You'll need the identifier on the back of the physical card to call this mutation.

When you use the API, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token belonging to the cardholder.
Then a `consentUrl` is returned which invites the user to start Strong Customer Authentication with Swan.

## Activation reminder notifications {#activation-reminders}

To encourage timely card activation, Swan can send reminder email notifications to users who haven't activated their physical cards after the estimated delivery date.

- Reminder notifications are sent at configured intervals (for example, 5, 10, and 15 days after estimated delivery).
- Notifications stop automatically when the user activates their card or when all reminders have been sent.
- Partners can enable or disable this feature from **Dashboard** > **Settings** > **Notifications**.

Review the [email notifications table](../../projects/index.mdx#notifications-email) on the Projects page for more information.
