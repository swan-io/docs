  <summary>⚠️ **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>
  <div>
🔗 On **April 1st**, we're removing the [deprecated field `Onboarding.redirectUrl`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding/#onboardingredirecturlstring---) from all onboarding mutations.
Instead, use the `OAuthRedirectParameters.redirectUrl` field, also in the [onboarding object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding#onboardingoauthredirectparametersoauthredirectparameters-).

✍ Starting on **April 1st**, the [`registrationNumber` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/onboard-company-account-holder-input/#onboardcompanyaccountholderinputregistrationnumberstring-) becomes mandatory for company onboardings, regardless of country.
This applies to all [onboardings](https://docs.swan.io/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs-company-account-holder) where `companyType` is set to `Company`, and where `companyType` is set to `SelfEmployed` and the account country is `France`.
Additionally, the `isRegistered` parameter will be set to `true` automatically for these onboardings.
Please note that this update doesn't impact capital deposits.

📓 Effective **May 1st**, providing [`gender`](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/gender/) for [Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBO)](/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs-ubo) is mandatory due to Swan’s reporting obligations.
This field includes more granular options than the `title` field, set to be deprecated on May 1st.
