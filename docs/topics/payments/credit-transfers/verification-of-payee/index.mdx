# Verification of Payee

Verify beneficiary details against their IBAN before sending SEPA Credit Transfers to reduce fraud and misdirected payments.

Starting **October 9, 2025**, Verification of Payee (VoP) becomes mandatory across Europe per the Instant Payments Regulation (IPR).

:::info Automatic integration
Swan automatically integrates VoP into existing credit transfer flows. Your current `initiateCreditTransfers` calls will include VoP verification with no required changes.
:::

## Overview {#overview}

When you call `initiateCreditTransfers`, Swan verifies the beneficiary name (and optionally company identifier) against the IBAN at the receiving bank before presenting the consent screen.

VoP works for all SEPA network transfers:
- **SEPA Credit Transfers** (regular and instant)
- **Internal Credit Transfers** between Swan accounts
- **Standing Orders** (verification required only at setup)

## VoP results in consent {#results}

Swan displays VoP results in the consent screen with one of four outcomes:

| Result | Description | User action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Match** ✅ | Name exactly matches bank records | Proceed with confidence |
| **Close Match** ⚠️ | Slight discrepancy (shows suggested name) | Review suggestion, proceed or correct |
| **No Match** ❌ | Name doesn't match bank records | Warning shown, can still proceed |
| **Verification Not Possible** ⚠️ | Technical issue prevented verification | Warning shown, can still proceed |

When VoP shows Close Match, No Match, or Verification Not Possible, users see a warning but can still authorize the payment.

## Pre-verification for better UX {#pre-verification}

For optimal user experience, especially with bulk payments, verify beneficiaries before initiating transfers:

1. **Call `verifySepaBeneficiary`** to verify beneficiary details
2. **Include verification tokens** in `initiateCreditTransfers` for faster processing
3. **Display verification results** in your interface before payment submission

This approach is particularly valuable for:
- Bulk payment processing
- Adding trusted beneficiaries
- Reducing consent screen friction

## Company bulk transfer options {#company-options}

Company accounts have two options for bulk transfers:

### Option 1: Pre-verification (recommended)
1. Use `verifySepaBeneficiary` to verify all beneficiaries
2. Include verification tokens in bulk `initiateCreditTransfers`
3. Single consent for all pre-verified transfers

### Option 2: VoP opt-out
1. Call `disableVerificationOfPayee` for the account
2. Bulk transfers skip VoP (warning shown in consent)
3. Single transfers still include automatic VoP

:::note Individual accounts
Individual accounts cannot opt out of VoP and must use pre-verification tokens for bulk transfers.

## Integration with existing flows {#integration}

### No changes required
Your existing credit transfer implementations work automatically:
- `initiateCreditTransfers` includes VoP by default
- `scheduleStandingOrder` verifies beneficiaries at setup
- Single transfers show VoP results in consent

### Enhanced flows (optional)
For better user experience:
- Add `verifySepaBeneficiary` to beneficiary management
- Include `beneficiaryVerificationToken` in transfer requests
- Handle VoP results in your interface

### Bulk transfer requirements
Starting October 9, 2025, bulk transfers require either:
- Verification tokens for each beneficiary, OR
- VoP opt-out enabled for company accounts

## Supported verification methods {#methods}

### Name-based verification
All beneficiaries can be verified using their full name:
- **Natural persons**: First and last name
- **Legal entities**: Legal name or commercial name

### Identifier-based verification (companies)
Legal entities can also use company identifiers for higher accuracy:
- `legalEntityIdentification` - LEI code
- `siren` - French SIREN number  
- `siret` - French SIRET number
- `centralBankIdentification` - National business registry

## Getting started {#getting-started}

### Immediate compliance (no action needed)
Swan handles VoP automatically starting October 9, 2025. Your existing transfers will include verification.

### Enhanced implementation (recommended)
1. **Test VoP scenarios** in Sandbox environment
2. **Add pre-verification** to your beneficiary workflows
3. **Handle bulk transfers** with tokens or opt-out
4. **Display VoP results** before payment submission
