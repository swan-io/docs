  <summary>⚠️ **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

💶 On **August 1st**, we're removing the `merchantPayment` field in the `InitiateCheckMerchantPaymentSuccessPayload`, use [`checkMerchantPayment`](/topics/merchants/online/checks/guide-initiate) instead. We're also deprecating `merchantPayment`.

🪪 Starting **August 7th,** we'll [recommend](/topics/users/identifications/#processes-recommendations) `QES` as the identification method for German accounts, replacing the current `Expert` level. If you use `Auto`, no action is needed. This change will apply automatically.

🛑 Starting **August 18th**, the `initiateCheckMerchantPayment` mutation will return a new rejection: `MerchantPaymentAlreadyExistsRejection`. This occurs when **you try to create a merchant payment** and the **CMC7 value** is already used by an existing payment that hasn't been `Rejected` or `Canceled`. If the existing payment with the same CMC7 *was* `Rejected` or `Canceled`, your mutation will still succeed.

💳 Starting **August 21st**, refund transactions will be linked to the `paymentId` of their original debit authorization when referenced by merchants. This change affects you only if you expect debit clearing transactions on a debit authorization.

📄 Starting **August 28th**, we'll start using these new, already available enum variables: `USPersonStatusDeclaration` and `ProofOfBusinessActivity` for [SupportingDocumentPurpose](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-purpose/), and `W9`, `W8`, and `CertificateOfLossOfNationality` for [SupportingDocumentType](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/supporting-document-type/).

📖 Starting **October 9th**, the new **[Verification of Payee](/preview/verification-of-payee/)** regulation takes effect.

👥 Starting **December 31st**, the `bookedBalanceAfter` field will be removed from the transaction query. Please use the `balanceAfter.amount` on `BookedTransactionStatusInfo`.
