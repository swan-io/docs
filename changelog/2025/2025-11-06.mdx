## Improvements

✅ The beneficiary name field in the [`verifyBeneficiary` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/verify-beneficiary/) now enforces a maximum length of 70 characters for SEPA beneficiaries and Swan accounts. This matches the maximum length supported for SEPA Credit Transfer initiations, preventing rejections during the payment flow.

💳 Recurring `SingleUseVirtualCard` instances now remain active when their cardholder's account member is disabled. When the membership is revoked, the card automatically reassigns to the account's Legal Representative, ensuring uninterrupted recurring expenses.

## Updates

📝 Starting **December 1st**, Swan Support will no longer manually register SEPA Direct Debit B2B mandates. You can now:

- Share a [SEPA Direct Debit B2B mandate registration link](/topics/payments/direct-debit/guide-add-mandate/#link) directly with your users.
- Embed the registration link in your application.
- Use [Swan's API](/topics/payments/direct-debit/guide-add-mandate/#api) to manage mandate registration programmatically.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🧹 Starting December 1st, the deprecated `companyInfoBySiren` query will be removed. Company information can now be retrieved directly during onboarding creation and updates, eliminating the need for separate queries.

🧹 On **February 5th, 2026**, the deprecated [`status` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/capital-deposit-case#capitaldepositcasestatuscapitaldepositcasestatus---) will be removed from the [`CapitalDepositCase` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/capital-deposit-case/). Migrate to the [`statusInfo` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/capital-deposit-case/#capitaldepositcasestatusinfocapitaldepositcasestatusinfo--), which was introduced on October 23rd. This provides [more granular status updates](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/capital-deposit-status), including `WaitingForInitialRequirements`, `PendingInternalReview`, and `WaitingForAdditionalInformation`.
