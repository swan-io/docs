| `Pending`          | Transaction was initiated, consent was granted, and the transaction is set to happen within a few days. The transactions aren't debited from the account yet, but they impact the account's `Pending` balance.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Booked`           | Completed transactions that are displayed on the official account statement. These transactions have been debited from the account, and they impact the account's `Booked` balance.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Released`         | Unique to card transactions, card authorizations might be released for specific reasons.`Released` transactions can impact the account balance. Refer to the [card payments section](../payments/cards/index.mdx#statuses) for more information.                                                                                                                                |
| `Canceled`         | An `Upcoming` transaction is canceled by someone with the right to do so, such as the [account holder](../onboarding/account-holders/index.mdx), an [account member](../accounts/memberships/index.mdx), or a [merchant](../merchants/index.mdx). Only transactions with the status `Upcoming` can be `Canceled`, and `Canceled` transactions don't impact the account balance. |
| `Rejected`         | Declined or refused transactions. For example, the beneficiary account might be closed, or the account's `Available` balance isn't sufficient to complete the transaction without resulting in a negative balance.                                                                                                                                                              |
