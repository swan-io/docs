# Build a compliant billing offer

All banking fees are legally framed and supervised by a regulator.
In France, the regulator is the *Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution*.
Some fees are capped or forbidden because they are considered abusive, depending on the account holder's status.
Therefore, only regulated entities can bill banking fees because they're subject to the regulator's supervision.

Swan Partners aren't [acting as regulated financial entities](../../../partnership/index.mdx), so you **can't bill directly** for banking fees.

However, if the product you've built brings value in the preparation of payment orders (or in some other way), you're authorized to bill for this functionality under the appropriate denomination.
In order to do so, your product must add value for your client.

:::caution Verification
Swan must **verify your billing offer** regarding the payment-related options before you go live to confirm you aren't billing for unauthorized fees.
