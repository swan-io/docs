## New features

📅 Set **card spending limits** based on **calendar periods** instead of only rolling periods. Calendar limits reset on fixed dates (e.g., the 1st of each month) rather than rolling windows (e.g., last 30 days), making budget control easier for finance teams. Configure them using the new `mode` field in `SpendingLimitInput` with options for `Daily`, `Weekly`, or `Monthly` recurrence.

## Improvements

🧭 SEPA Credit Transfers received without a customer-provided reference now display as empty strings in Web Banking and the API, instead of showing `NotProvided`.

📖 [Identify which user initiated a credit transfer](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/guide-initiate-ct/#identify-initiator) by querying the payment before consent is granted, or by storing user details at the time of initiation.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

👮 Starting **February 5**, new rejections apply to the [`openAccount`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/open-account/) mutation to prevent fraud patterns involving successive opening and closing of [multiple accounts](/topics/accounts/multiple-accounts/) to bypass the [account creation limit](/topics/accounts/multiple-accounts/#account-creation-limit):

- All accounts now count toward the maximum limit regardless of status (`Opened`, `Suspended`, `Closing`, or `Closed`). Previously, only `Opened` accounts counted. This change affects the existing `AccountHolderAccountsCreationLimitRejection`.
- If one or more of the account holder's accounts is `Suspended`, Swan rejects opening multiple accounts with `AccountHolderAccountsSuspendedStatusNotEligibleRejection`.

🚫 Starting **February 28**, the following rules apply to [limited accounts](/topics/accounts/#account-type-level):

- Incoming international transfers or SEPA Credit Transfers (instant or standard) exceeding **€50** are automatically rejected.
- The maximum cumulative balance is **€150**.
- Any incoming transfer, regardless of amount, that would cause the balance to exceed this ceiling is also rejected.

This change mainly affects the first incoming transfer made while the account holder is still completing verification. During this phase, the account remains limited, and any transfer exceeding these limits is automatically rejected.
