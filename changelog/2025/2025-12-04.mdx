## Improvements

🔗 Supporting documents for merchant profiles can now be provided via a Web Banking link. The upload form URL is available in the associated supporting document collection under `supportingDocumentCollectionUrl`. Share this URL with your users so they can upload documents directly in Web Banking.

📩 Email notifications for account opening and member invitations are now white-labelled, allowing seamless integration with your product's brand. This applies to:

- Your account terms and conditions.
- First transfer.
- Request supporting documents (including reminders).
- Your account is opened.
- Join your banking space.

Some notifications can be configured with your Account Manager. Your project's current configuration has already been applied to avoid disruptions.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🛡️ Starting **December 18**, we're introducing stricter input validation for several mutations to improve security and error handling. The following fields now strictly enforce specific formats. Providing an incorrect value returns a `ValidationRejection` error:

- `addVirtualIbanEntry`: The `accountId` field now accepts **only** a valid UUID.
- `disableAccountMembership` and `resumeAccountMembership`: The `accountMembershipId` field now accepts **only** a valid UUID.
- `resumeAccountMembership`: The `consentRedirectUrl` field now accepts **only** a valid URL format.
