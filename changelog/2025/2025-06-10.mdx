## Improvements

üß≠ Account statement documents now use a new naming convention for better readability and to include the document language: 
AccountStatement_[ProjectName]_[AccountNumber]_[period]_[documentLanguage]

üë´ Account member invitations in `ConsentPending` [status](/topics/accounts/memberships/#statuses) now expire if the inviter doesn't consent before the consent period ends. 
As a result, the account membership status automatically changes to `Disabled`. 
This lets you inform the user that they must send a new invitation.
- When querying `AccountMembershipDisabledStatusInfo`, you'll see the reason `InvitationExpired`.
- If you're subscribed to the `AccountMembership.Updated` webhook, you'll receive a notification when the membership is `Disabled`.

‚úçÔ∏è You can now use [`checkMerchantPayment`](/topics/merchants/online/checks/guide-initiate) to track the [statuses](/topics/merchants/online/checks/#payments-statuses) and [balances](/topics/merchants/online/checks/#payments-balances) of French check payments. 
As a result, we're deprecating the `merchantPayment` field on `InitiateCheckMerchantPaymentSuccessPayload`, use `checkMerchantPayment` instead.

## API updates
