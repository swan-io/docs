# Fraud protection

Fraud attacks grow more complex every day.
It's important to know how Swan works to keep you and your users safe, as well as how to prevent, react to, and report suspicions of fraud.

Review the page covering [common types of fraud](./types.mdx) to understand types of fraud your users might face.

## Swan protects you and your users {#protect}

Your protection is Swan's priority.
Consider the following ways Swan strives to keep you and your users safe.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Area</th>
    <th>Protection</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">∗ **Contact with your users**</td>
    <td>**Swan never calls your users unexpectedly**. If a user receives an unplanned phone call from Swan, strongly encourage them to hang up, then inform you and Swan immediately.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To keep communication with you and your users secure, Swan prefers that both you and your users **open tickets instead of emailing Support**. The [partner](https://partner-support.swan.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new) and [end-user](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18444696903837) support forms initiate a secure way to communicate about sensitive topics.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Swan might ask your user to **verify their name** or **phone number** to confirm their identity. Any other requests for sensitive or account information are made through official tickets and exclusively for a precise purpose, such as an enhanced transaction review.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">**Authentication** and **Consent**</td>
    <td>To access Swan platforms, you and your users must [**log in**](../../../topics/users/index.mdx#login). If there's no activity for a set time period, you're [**automatically logged out**](../../../developers/index.mdx#ttl) to ensure the security of your account.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Swan uses a mix of biometrics, passcodes, and one-time passwords to **secure access** to Swan platforms.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You and your users must **[consent](../../../topics/users/consent/index.mdx#sensitive) to all sensitive operations**.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">**Payments**</td>
    <td>Swan offers [single-use virtual cards (SUVs)](../../../topics/cards/virtual/index.mdx#suv). Consider **prioritizing issuing SUVs** as it's more difficult to use them fraudulently.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You and your users can **save [trusted beneficiaries](../../../topics/payments/credit-transfers/index.mdx#beneficiaries)**. Only eligible account members can send credit transfers to unsaved beneficiaries.</td>
  </tr>
  <td>When making online payments, you and your users must **complete [3-D Secure (3DS)](../../../topics/payments/cards/index.mdx#3ds)**, an extra security layer when paying online. Please note that Mastercard might bypass 3DS if they decide a payment is low risk.</td>
</table>

∗ *You, your users, and Swan each have a direct relationship due to the [three-party partnership model](../../index.mdx#model).
As a result, Swan contacts your users directly, when necessary, respecting strict privacy guidelines.*

## Manage fraud {#manage}

### Prevent {#prevent}

<mark>add content about preventing fraud</mark>

### React {#react}

If you or your users suspect fraud, **please react immediately**.
Remember, Swan never contacts you or your users to transfer money outside of established Support channels.
As a Swan Partner, you also shouldn't contact your users to transfer money.

:::caution Communication channels
If a request feels urgent, your users should contact the requester using a second, previously known communication channel.
For example, if your user **receives an email request**, they should **call the requester** using a phone number they already have—not a phone number provided in the original email.
:::

Swan invites you and your users to **be SAFE, not sorry** (borrowing from the [Yale University Information Security Office](https://cybersecurity.yale.edu/)).
Encourage the following behavior from your users, and practice it yourselves.

| Action | Explanation |
| :---: | --- |
| **`S`**<br />**See something suspicious?** | Be alert for situations that feel unusually urgent or questionable. Here are a few examples of suspicious incidents:<br /><br /><ul><li>You receive an urgent email from your company's CEO asking you to transfer money outside of the normal process.</li><li>You receive a text message asking you to consent to a transaction, but you're not actively shopping online with a Swan virtual card.</li><li>Someone calls you on your personal phone claiming to be a reputable charity association, but asks for a donation in an unconventional way.</li><li>You receive an unexpected invoice with payment details you don't recognize.</li></ul> |
| **`A`**<br />**Act quickly** | [Report](#report) the incident to Swan right away. Don't wait, don't be embarrassed, and don't let someone talk you out of your gut feeling about the incident.<br /><br />However, don't respond quickly to the request. Wait to transfer funds or provide information until it's confirmed to be a legitimate request. |
| **`F`**<br />**Follow instructions** | Provide Swan with all requested information as quickly as possible. Stay actively responsive as Swan follows up on the incident. |
| **`E`**<br />**Exercise discretion** | Be careful until you know the account is secure. [Reset passcodes](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/20531243310749), limit [account membership permissions](../../../topics/accounts/memberships/index.mdx#permissions), and anything else you feel might protect you until the incident is resolved. |
