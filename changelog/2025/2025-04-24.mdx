## New features

ðŸ’³ You can now [set a preferred shipping provider](/topics/cards/physical/#shipping-methods) for physical cards, when calling the `addCards` mutation.
To do this, select `shippingProvider` in the `physicalCardCustomOptions` input.

ðŸ“¥ You can now [export account membership data](/topics/accounts/memberships/guide-export) in `.csv` format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportAccountMembershipData` mutation.

## Improvements

ðŸ§­ We improved the `executionDate` field for card transactions.
It now shows the precise timestamp from Mastercard, giving you additional visibility on the time when the transaction was received by the network.

ðŸ”Ž We've released several updates to improve your Dashboard:

- You can now apply new filters to the following Dashboard pages:
    - Accounts: `IBAN`
    - Account memberships: `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName`
    - Account holders: `firstName` and `lastName`
    - Onboarding: `email`
    - Users: `firstName` and `lastName`
- We've increased the size of the search bar, making it easier to view and input text.
- The search bar now automatically removes unwanted spaces from your input, ensuring more accurate results.

## Update

ðŸ§¾ Starting May 1st, invoices will be issued through our new billing provider, Lago.
The format will change, but the content will remain the same.
