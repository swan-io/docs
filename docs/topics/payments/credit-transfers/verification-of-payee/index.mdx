# Verification of Payee

Verify beneficiary details against their IBAN before sending SEPA Credit Transfers to reduce fraud and misdirected payments.

**Starting October 9, 2025**, Verification of Payee (VoP) becomes mandatory across Europe per the Instant Payments Regulation (IPR).

:::info Automatic integration
Swan automatically integrates VoP into existing credit transfer flows. Your current `initiateCreditTransfers` calls will include VoP verification with no required changes.
:::

## Business Benefits {#benefits}

VoP provides immediate value to your users and business:

- **Fraud Prevention**: Verify recipient details before payment execution
- **User Trust**: Clear feedback builds confidence in payment accuracy  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet IPR requirements automatically starting October 9, 2025
- **Reduced Disputes**: Fewer misdirected payments and customer support issues

## How VoP Works {#how-it-works}

When you call `initiateCreditTransfers`, Swan verifies the beneficiary name against the IBAN at the receiving bank before presenting the consent screen.

VoP works for all SEPA network transfers:
- **SEPA Credit Transfers** (regular and instant)
- **Internal Credit Transfers** between Swan accounts
- **Standing Orders** (verification required only at setup)

### VoP Results in Consent {#results}

Swan displays VoP results in the consent screen with one of four outcomes:

| Result | Description | User Experience | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Match** ✅ | Exact name match | ✅ Proceed normally | Continue to consent |
| **Close Match** ⚠️ | Slight discrepancy | ⚠️ Show suggested name | User can proceed or correct |
| **No Match** ❌ | Name doesn't match | ⚠️ Warning displayed | User can proceed with warning |
| **Verification Not Possible** ⚠️ | Technical failure | ⚠️ Service unavailable | User can proceed or retry |

When VoP shows Close Match, No Match, or Verification Not Possible, users see a warning but can still authorize the payment.

## Implementation Strategy {#strategy}

### Essential (MVP Implementation)
1. **Call `verifySepaBeneficiary`** when users add beneficiaries
2. **Include tokens** in `initiateCreditTransfers` when available  
3. **Handle all 4 result types** in your UI
4. **Test with sandbox IBANs** before going live

### Enhanced (Post-MVP)
- Pre-verification for bulk payments
- Company opt-out management  
- Legal identifier collection

## Regulatory Timeline {#timeline}

- **July 2025**: Swan APIs available in Sandbox
- **August 2025**: Partner integration testing
- **October 9, 2025**: VoP becomes mandatory (automatic activation)

Swan handles all regulatory compliance automatically. No action required for basic functionality.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

### Immediate compliance (no action needed)
Swan handles VoP automatically starting October 9, 2025. Your existing transfers will include verification.

### Enhanced implementation (recommended)
1. **Test VoP scenarios** in Sandbox environment
2. **Add pre-verification** to your beneficiary workflows
3. **Display VoP results** before payment submission

## API Overview {#api-overview}

### Core APIs for MVP

**Pre-verification** (recommended):
```graphql
verifySepaBeneficiary(
  input: VerifySepaBeneficiaryInput!
): VerifySepaBeneficiaryPayload!
```

**Enhanced credit transfers**:
```graphql
initiateCreditTransfers(
  input: InitiateCreditTransfersInput!
): InitiateCreditTransfersPayload!
```

**Standing orders**:
```graphql
scheduleStandingOrder(
  input: ScheduleStandingOrderInput!
): ScheduleStandingOrderPayload!
```

## Implementation Effort {#effort}

| Integration Level | Development Time | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Basic** | 0 hours | Automatic VoP in consent (no changes needed) |
| **Recommended** | 2-5 days | Pre-verification, result display, error handling |
| **Advanced** | 1-2 weeks | Company identifiers, bulk optimization |
