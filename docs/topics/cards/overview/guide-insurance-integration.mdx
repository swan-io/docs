This guide explains how to configure insurance on card products, issue cards with insurance, support card insurance claims.

## 1. Configure insurance on card products

When creating a card product, link it to a card insurance object by setting the [`defaultInsurancePackage`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/card-insurance-configuration/#cardinsuranceconfigurationdefaultinsurancepackagecardinsurancepackage). 
This package is automatically applied when a card is issued.

The `availableInsurancePackages` field lists all eligible insurance packages for the card product.

By default, new card products include three packages: **Basic**, **Essential**, and **Premium**. For pre-existing card products, contact your Product Integration Manager (PIM) to add the `availableInsurancePackages` and set your `defaultInsurancePackage`.

## 2. Card product review and validation

After configuring your insurance settings, your PIM will review and validate the card product before it can be used.

:::caution
To issue cards with insurance, it's mandatory to display the [standard marketing and legal mentions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/159nE02OtxcZ_uVQIpX8H7fLVC9VubPAf/edit?slide=id.g33c8ca1d644_0_302#slide=id.g33c8ca1d644_0_302) regarding the insurance coverage package within your app or website. Swan includes this information in the Terms and Conditions.

## 3. Card insurance subscription

Swan automatically creates a [card insurance subscription](/topics/cards/overview/insurance-on-cards#insurance-subscription) when a new card is issued, if the following conditions are met:

- The cardholder's account membership is `Enabled`.
- The account holder is `Verified`.

## 4. Support insurance claims 

Include a link to the insurance provider's claims portal in your Web banking app so users can file claims independently.

The `claimsUrl` available in the card query leads to the insurance provider's claims portal. 
Use this query to retrieve the `claimsUrl` for a cardholder to access the claims interface:
