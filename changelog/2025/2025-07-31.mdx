## New features

📖 **Learn about the new [Verification of Payee regulation](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/verification-of-payee/)**, its impact on your users, and how you can update your Swan integration to improve your payment experience.

## Improvements

👥 Get more balance information for booked transactions using `BookedTransactionStatusInfo.balanceAfter`. This object provides:
- `amount` - replaces the existing `BookedBalanceAfter.amount` (see upcoming breaking changes).
- `sequenceNumber` - new account-level transaction counter for new transactions (historical transactions show `null`).

🧭 **Customize column width on all Dashboard pages** to make the data easier to read.

🪝 **Two new webhooks** are now available to update you on **rolling reserve changes**. `TransactionRollingReserve.Updated` is triggered when the release date is changed, and `TransactionRollingReserve.Released` will indicate that the reserved funds are now available.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

📄 Starting **August 28th**, we'll start using these new, already available enum variables: `USPersonStatusDeclaration` and `ProofOfBusinessActivity` for [SupportingDocumentPurpose](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-purpose/), and `W9`, `W8`, and `CertificateOfLossOfNationality` for [SupportingDocumentType](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/supporting-document-type/).

👥 Starting **December 31st**, the `bookedBalanceAfter` field will be removed from the transaction query. Please use the `balanceAfter.amount` on `BookedTransactionStatusInfo`.
