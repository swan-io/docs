# View sensitive information

The `cardUrl` available in the `card` query leads to website that displays the card with its design and its sensitive hidden information.

Consider integrating it into your product with an iframe or a webview.
This URL is available for one hour after you query it.
After one hour, renew the query to get another `cardUrl`.

:::note Information not visible
If information fails to become visible despite having the appropriate permissions, it may remain hidden due to regulatory restrictions based on your location.

## View physical card numbers {#view-number}

View the physical card numbers, which is different from the virtual card numbers, by calling the `viewPhysicalCardNumbers` mutation which returns a consent.
When you do this, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token using the name of the card's account member.
Then a `consentUrl` is returned, inviting the user to start the Strong Customer Authentication with Swan.

import AfterConsent from "../partials/_after-consent.mdx";

<AfterConsent />

:::info Store `consentId`
To avoid repeating the Strong Customer Authentication each time the client wants to reveal the card numbers, the same `consentUrl` can be called anytime for five minutes after the consent.
We advise you to store the `consentId` on your side and run a consent query to check the consent status is `Accepted` and the `updateAt` is less than five minutes, before reusing the `consentUrl`.
The `consentUrl` only works in the card holder's browser where the consent was completed.
:::

## View PIN {#view-pin}

You can display the physical card's PIN by calling the `viewPhysicalCardPinmutation` which returns a consent.
When you do this, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token using the name of the card's account member.
Then a `consentUrl` is returned which invites the user to start the Strong Customer Authentication with Swan.

If your card was created before 19:00 Central European [Summer] Time (CET/CEST), you can call the mutation starting from 19:00 the same day.
Otherwise, you'll have to wait until the next day at 19:00 to start calling the mutation.

You can check the `isPINReady` boolean (true/false) in the physical card's `statusInfo`, with `ToActivate` status.
It will be true when the PIN is available.
