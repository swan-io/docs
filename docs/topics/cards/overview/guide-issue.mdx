# Issue cards

Use this overarching guide to help you issue the types of cards you need with the design you want.
It's likely that not all of the guides linked here apply to your use case.

## Step 1: Configure your card design

Choose a standard or custom card design, then choose your packaging.

→ [Configure standard cards](../design/guide-standard.mdx)

→ [Design custom cards](../design/guide-custom.mdx)

→ [Choose your packaging](../design/index.mdx#packaging) (available for both standard and custom card designs)

## Step 2: Add account members

Before being issued a card, each future card holder must become a member of that account.

→ [Add account members](../../accounts/memberships/index.mdx)

:::caution Card language
[Card language](../index.mdx#language) is chosen when adding account memberships.
Please ask your user to choose their card language, or choose it for them, before continuing to step 3.

## Step 3: Add a virtual card

You can add one or multiple virtual cards.
You can also have the physical card printed at the same time the virtual card is created.

→ [Add one virtual card](../virtual/guide-add.mdx#add-one)

→ [Add multiple virtual cards](../virtual/guide-add.mdx#add-multiple)

→ [Print a physical card when adding a virtual card](../virtual/guide-add.mdx#print-with-virtual)

## Step 4: Get card information

As soon as you add a virtual card, it's available for eCommerce transactions immediately.
You'll need the card number and other sensitive information to make those transactions.

→ [View a virtual card's sensitive information](../virtual/guide-view-info.mdx)

## Step 5: Digitize or print the virtual card

You might want to add the virtual card to a digital Wallet or print a physical card.

→ [Print one physical card](../physical/guide-print.mdx#print-one)

→ [Print multiple physical cards with group delivery](../physical/guide-print.mdx#print-group)

→ [Add digital cards to Apple Pay and Google Pay](../digital/guide-add.mdx)

## Step 6: Update card settings

You can update the settings for a [card product](../index.mdx#card-product) at any time.
Settings apply to all card types: virtual, physical, and digital.
