## New features

ðŸ”— [Send a SEPA Direct Debit B2B mandate registration link](/topics/payments/direct-debit/guide-add-mandate/#link) to users with the `canInitiatePayments` permission. Get the link from your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Accounts** page.

## Improvements

ðŸ’³ [One-off single use virtual cards](/topics/cards/virtual/#suv-one-off) now default to expiring **30 days** after creation.
This applies when `SpendingLimitPeriod` is set to `Always` in the `addSingleUseVirtualCard` and `addSingleUseVirtualCards` mutations. 
You can change this by setting a custom `cardContractExpiryDate`.

ðŸ§­ **Transaction confirmation documents** now follow a new, more readable naming convention that includes the document language. 
The new format is: `TransactionConfirmation_[transactionId]_[documentLanguage]`.

## Updates

ðŸªª Starting **August 7th,** we'll [recommend](/topics/users/identifications/#processes-recommendations) `QES` as the identification method for German accounts, replacing the current `Expert` level. If you use `Auto`, no action is needed. This change will apply automatically.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

ðŸ›‘ Starting **August 18th**, the `initiateCheckMerchantPayment` mutation will return a new rejection: `MerchantPaymentAlreadyExistsRejection`. This occurs when **you try to create a merchant payment**, but the **CMC7 value** is already used by an existing payment that hasn't been `Rejected` or `Canceled`. If the existing payment with the same CMC7 *was* `Rejected` or `Canceled`, your mutation will still succeed.

ðŸ’³ Starting **August 21st**, refund transactions will be linked to the `paymentId` of their original debit authorization when referenced by merchants. This change affects you only if you expect debit clearing transactions on a debit authorization.
