    ‚úîÔ∏è Starting **October 31st**, the `beneficiaryVerification` query will be deprecated. Use the `verifyBeneficiary` mutation instead to ensure uninterrupted service.

    ‚öñÔ∏è Starting **October 31st**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be a mandatory field at onboarding when an account holder's residency country does not match the `accountCountry`. This is to comply with [CRS (Common Reporting Standard) regulations](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf).

    üìÑ On **November 12th**:

This field is deprecated and no longer serves any purpose.
    - The [`redirectUrl` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding#onboardingredirecturlstring---) will be removed from both the [`Onboarding`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding) and [`OnboardingInfo`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding-info) objects. It has been deprecated for two years and replaced by the [`oauthRedirectParameters` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/oauth-redirect-parameters/).
    - The [`title` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/individual-ultimate-beneficial-owner#individualultimatebeneficialownertitletitleenum-) will be removed from the [Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/individual-ultimate-beneficial-owner/).

    - The [`onboardingState` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding-info/#onboardinginfoonboardingstateonboardingstate-) will be removed from the [`OnboardingInfo` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding-info/). This field is deprecated and no longer serves any purpose.

    üìù Starting **November 12th**, the `onboarding(id: ID!)` query may return `null` when no onboarding exists for the given ID, instead of always returning an `Onboarding` object.

    üßπ On **December 1st**, the deprecated `totalCapitalDepositAmount` field will be removed from the [`CreateCapitalDepositCaseInput` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/create-capital-deposit-case-input/). The total is now computed automatically from shareholder contribution amounts. It remains available in responses.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Starting **January 23rd, 2026**, the following fields will be removed from the [`accountStatement`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/account-statement/) and [`accountStatements`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/account-statements/) queries and from the [`generateAccountStatement` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/generate-account-statement/) response:

    - `fees` is replaced by `feeCredits` and `feeDebits`.
