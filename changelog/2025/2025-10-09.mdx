## Improvements

📭 We've implemented a Regex to enforce better formatting for the [`postalCode`](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/complete-address-input/#completeaddressinputpostalcodestring--) field in physical addresses when ordering cards.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🔍 Starting **November 12th**, the [onboarding(id: ID!)` query](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/onboarding) may return `null` when no onboarding exists for the given ID, instead of always returning an `Onboarding` object.

🔄 On **November 12th**:
- The `verificationFlow` field will be removed from the `OnboardingInfo` object. This field is deprecated and no longer serves any purpose.
- The `redirectUrl` field will be removed from both the `Onboarding` and `OnboardingInfo` objects. It has been deprecated for two years and replaced by the `oauthRedirectParameters` object.
- The `title` field will be removed from the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) object. It has been deprecated and replaced by the `gender` field.
- The `onboardingState` field will be removed from the `OnboardingInfo` object. This field is deprecated and no longer serves any purpose.

### Updates

💸 On **October 19th**, we will introduce the following updates to the `initiateCreditTransfers` endpoint to improve its usability and clarity:

- The `save` parameter now defaults to `false`.
- The `mode` parameter is now a **required** field. The default value is set to `Regular`.
- The `isMyOwnIban` and `beneficiaryId` input fields have been **removed**.
- The API now returns a `ValidationRejection` error instead of `ForbiddenRejection` when an input contains **invalid** data.

⚖️ Starting **October 31st**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be a mandatory field at onboarding when an account holder's residency country does not match the `accountCountry`. This is to comply with [CRS (Common Reporting Standard) regulations](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf).
