# Company account onboarding

import CompanyOnboardingDefinition from '../../definitions/_onboarding-company.mdx';

> <CompanyOnboardingDefinition />
> **Self-employed** users hold company accounts.
Refer to the country requirements section for more information about identification for self-employed users.

## Process overview {#overview}

Company onboarding supports different types of organizations, including:

- Several types of companies
- Self-employed workers
- Associations or not-for-profit organizations

import OnboardingOverview from '../partials/_overview.mdx';

<OnboardingOverview accountType="a company" />

## Company onboarding form {#onboarding-form}

The company onboarding form begins by gathering preliminary details about the company.
Then, Swan collects the following information:

1. User's **email address**.
1. Legal information about the organization, including the **company name**, **registration number** (optional), **VAT number** (optional), and **address**, as well as details about the organization's **activity** and **expected monthly volume**.
1. Information about the company's **ultimate beneficial owners** (UBO).
This step only applies if the user selected **company**, **home owner association**, or **other** when submitting their preliminary details.
1. **Required documents** to verify your organization. You might not see this step in your onboarding process.
1. User [**signs up**](../../users/index.mdx#signup) for Swan.

### Expected monthly volume {#onboarding-form-volume}

Swan uses the expected monthly volume provided during onboarding to monitor the account.
It's essential to select the range that corresponds to the company's actual volume, and to notify Swan if that expected monthly volume changes during the account's lifecycle.

If you use Swan's onboarding form, this information is collected by default.
If you design your own form, please offer the following ranges:

- Less than 10 000€ (`LessThan10000`)
- Between 10 000€ and 50 000€ (`Between10000And50000`)
- Between 50 000€ and 100 000€ (`Between50000And100000`)
- More than 100 000€ (`MoreThan100000`)

### Country-specific info {#onboarding-form-country}

Requested information can change based on your account country.
Refer to the tables later on this page for country-specific requirements.

## Identification recommendations {#identification-recommendations}

Swan must verify the identity of the [legal representative](../../../glossary.mdx#legal-representative) for each company.
Swan supports multiple [**identification processes**](../../users/identifications/index.mdx#levels-processes), and some require a [**first transfer**](../account-holders/index.mdx#first-transfer).
For company onboarding, the following levels are recommended based on the account country.

| Account country | Recommended level for legal representative | Other supported levels |
|---|---|---|
| 🇫🇷 France | **✓ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| 🇩🇪 Germany | **✓ Expert** | QES |
| 🇮🇹 Italy | **✓ QES** | Expert + first transfer |
| 🇳🇱 Netherlands | **✓ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| 🇪🇸 Spain | **✓ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |

:::info Self-employed account holders
- **France unregistered self-employed**: PVID, or Expert and first transfer to your Swan account (QES is technically accepted but not preferred)
- **France registered self-employed**: Expert
- **Germany self-employed**: QES and first transfer to your Swan account
