# Get a list of required onboarding documents

Get a list of required [supporting documents](../../accounts/documents/index.mdx) for your onboarding using the API.
Add information about collecting supporting documents to the success payload when creating an onboarding link.

:::info Empty list
The mutation might return an **empty list of required documents**.
This is expected behavior, meaning no supporting documents are required for this onboarding at this time.
:::

## Guide

1. Create your onboarding link for an [individual](../individual/guide-create.mdx) or a [company](../company/guide-create.mdx).
1. Add the `supportingDocumentCollection` field and the `requiredSupportingDocumentPurposes` subfield to the success payload.
You might also choose to add collection status info.

## Mutation

:::caution Partial mutation
Add this information to the full mutation when creating an [individual](../individual/guide-create.mdx) or [company](../company/guide-create.mdx) onboarding link.
Note that the example features company onboarding.
:::

```graphql {4,12-15,17-18} showLineNumbers
mutation ListRequiredDocuments {
  onboardCompanyAccountHolder {
  {...}
    ... on OnboardCompanyAccountHolderSuccessPayload {
      __typename
      onboarding {
        id
        onboardingState
        statusInfo {
          status
        }
        supportingDocumentCollection {
          requiredSupportingDocumentPurposes {
            acceptableSupportingDocumentTypes
            name
          }
          statusInfo {
            status
          }
        }
      }
    }
  {...}
  }
}

```
