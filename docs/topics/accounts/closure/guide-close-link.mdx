# Send a link to close an account

If the account's [legal representative](../../../glossary.mdx#legal-representative) (legal rep) requests account closure, send them a link to complete the process.

:::caution Suspended accounts
Only Swan can act on `Suspended` accounts.
If the [status](../index.mdx#statuses) is `Suspended`, you can't send a link to close the account.

## Step 1: Send link to legal rep {#send-link}

1. Go to your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Accounts**.
1. Locate the account closure link in the **Close account** tile.
1. **Click-to-copy** the link.
1. Send the link to the account's legal rep.

:::note Tracking closure
Keep track of the account closure process on **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Accounts**.
Consider subscribing to the `Account.Closing` and `Account.Closed` [webhooks](../../../developers/using-api/webhooks.mdx#events-accounts) to be notified when the [account status](../index.mdx#statuses) changes.

## Step 2: Legal rep completes process {#complete-process}

The account's legal rep opens the link you provide, then logs into their banking app.
They choose a reason for account closure, then consent to closing the account with [Strong Customer Authentication](../../users/consent/index.mdx#sca).

To complete the account closure process, the balance must be zero.
The following table explains the actions required to reach a zero balance.

| Balance | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ➕ Positive | Transfer the funds **out of** the account with a SEPA Credit Transfer. |
| ➖ Negative | Swan works with your end users to reach a zero balance. |

:::tip Timeline
After consenting to account closure and reaching a zero balance, the account is closed **within 30 days**.
