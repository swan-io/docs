# Cancel physical cards

If a physical card is lost, stolen, damaged, or hasn't been delivered, call the `cancelPhysicalCard` mutation to cancel the card.

:::caution cancellation is irreversible
Canceling a physical card is a permanent action that can't be reversed.
This guide explains how to cancel a physical card and how it impacts connected digital and virtual cards.
:::

## Guide {#guide}

1. Call the `cancelPhysicalCard` mutation. 
1. Add the `cardId` for the physical card you're canceling (line 2) 
1. Select the reason for cancelling the card. (line 2).
1. Add the `CancelPhysicalCardSuccessPayload`, including any information you'd like to review (line 3).

```graphql {2-3} showLineNumbers
mutation MyMutation {
  cancelPhysicalCard(input: { cardId: "$YOUR_CARD_ID", reason: Lost }) {
    ... on CancelPhysicalCardSuccessPayload {
      __typename
      physicalCard {
        statusInfo {
          ... on PhysicalCardCanceledStatusInfo {
            __typename
            status
            reason
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Payload {#payload}

The payload confirms that the physical card is `Canceled` (line 8) because it was reprted as `Lost` (line 9).

```json {8} showLineNumbers
{
  "data": {
    "cancelPhysicalCard": {
      "__typename": "CancelPhysicalCardSuccessPayload",
      "physicalCard": {
        "statusInfo": {
          "__typename": "PhysicalCardCanceledStatusInfo",
          "status": "Canceled",
          "reason": "Lost"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
:::caution Lost or stolen cards
If the physical card was lost or stolen, ask the cardholder the following questions:

1. Did the cardholder digitize their physical card?
1. If so, was the cardholder's mobile device lost or stolen?

**If both answers are yes, make sure to cancel their digital cards as well.**
:::

## Digital and virtual cards {#digital-virtual-cards}
When a physical card is canceled, digital cards linked to the physical card will also be canceled.
Virtual cards will not be affected.

:::tip 
Swan recommends only digitizing virtual cards for a safer experience.
:::

Refer to the guides for [digital](../digital/guide-cancel.mdx) and [virtual](../virtual/guide-cancel.mdx) cards if you need to cancel those as well.
