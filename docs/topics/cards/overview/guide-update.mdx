# Update card settings

Update most settings for your card product.

:::note
To understand all options for card product settings, please review the [explanatory content](../index.mdx#settings).

## API guide {#guide-api}

Card product settings are **valid for all payments** linked to the card, including all virtual, physical, and digital cards.

1. Update all card settings by calling the `updateCard` mutation.
1. When updating card settings, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token associated with the correct account member.
    - Additionally, the account member must have the [membership permission](../../accounts/memberships/index.mdx#permissions) `canManageCards`.
    - The permission `canManageAccountMembership` is optional.
1. The request from this mutation returns a newly created consent resource containing the `consentUrl`.
1. The URL allows you to redirect the user making the modification to Swan's [Strong Customer Authentication](../../users/consent/index.mdx#sca).

After the consent process is completed, the card is updated and its attribute version is increased by one.
