# Cancel virtual cards

:::info Original content
To immediately and permanently cancel a virtual card and all physical and digital cards associated with it, call the `cancelCard` mutation.
You might think about cancellation as **deactivating** the card.

All types of cards associated to the virtual card will no longer be usable.
The card's status is `Canceling` during the process, which is irreversible, and the status changes to `Canceled` when the process is complete.

After the cancellation is complete, you'll no longer be billed for the card.
