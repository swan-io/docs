# Projects overview

Using Swan means using projects.

**Partners** can have anywhere from one project to a large number of projects depending on the implementation.
Typically, there is one project per use case.
**Users** can belong to as many projects as needed.
They always use the **same identifier** (their phone number) to sign in.

## Project owner {#owner}

Projects are owned by the **legal entity** who opens a **project's first Live account** when activating a Swan project.

Additionally, the project owner's **legal representative** can perform specific actions, for example implementing security measures such as server consent or viewing their own card numbers with the API.

In Sandbox, you can use the mutation `promoteAccountHolderToProjectOwner` to promote any account holder to test project owner behavior.

## Project ID {#id}

Each project has a unique project ID (`projectId`).
On the Dashboard, click-to-copy your Project ID from any page.

## Project access tokens {#access-tokens}

Project access tokens serve several functions:

1. Allow you to **act on your own behalf** rather than on behalf of a user.
1. Allow you to **act as a user within your project**, sometimes referred to as [impersonation](../../developers/using-api/authentication/guide-impersonate.mdx).
1. Must use the **client credentials** OAuth 2.0 flow (also referred to as *grant type*), intended for server-to-server authentication.

Learn more about project access tokens, including [how to get them](../../developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-project.mdx), in the [authentication](../../developers/using-api/authentication/index.mdx) section.

## Sandbox and Live projects {#environments}

Projects always start as Sandbox-only.
Projects can remain Sandbox-only if you're goal for the project is to test various implementations.

After a project passes to the status `LimitedLiveAccess`, the project owner can begin testing the Live implementation.
From there, more and more Live access is granted (assuming the project passes reviews).

After a project is Live, you can switch between Sandbox and Live.
Use Sandbox to test new features before releasing them to your Live users.

For regulatory reasons, it's **not possible to delete projects** or clear data from a project.

:::caution Can't move between projects
You can't migrate work between projects.
If you have a Live project and you'd like to test an implementation in Sandbox before launching, use that Live project's Sandbox mode.
