### Improvements

✖️ Cancel `Upcoming` Instant SEPA Credit Transfers (`SepaInstantCreditTransferOut`) from your Dashboard.

🖊️ [Check returns](/topics/merchants/online/checks/#r-transactions) now have a specific `returnReason`.
These reasons can be tested using the `simulateIncomingCheckReturn` mutation with the `reasonCode` field.

🙅🏾 Check why a capital deposit document was refused from your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Capital deposits**.

🔎 Search accounts by account ID on your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Accounts**.
You will need to enter the full account ID.

💳 Issued card transaction types `CardOutDebit`, `CardOutDebitReversal`, `CardOutCredit`, and `CardOutCreditReversal` are now received and created 3 times per day (previously 1 time per day). This will improve user experience and positively impact performance.

📱 We added a second SMS/text message provider.
Sending text messages will automatically switch between the two providers in case of an outage.

### Upcoming breaking changes

💥 Reminder: on **July 15th**, the Ultimate Beneficial Owner's (UBO) residency country (`individualUltimateBeneficialOwners.residencyAddress.country`) becomes mandatory in our [onboarding API](/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs-ubo).

🌐 In **4 weeks**, only `AccountLanguage` [enum values](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/account-language/) for `language` will be accepted in the [onboarding object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding).
Previously, this field was a string and accepted other values.
Please take this into account to avoid any breaking changes.
