Rolling reserve is a policy through which Swan holds a certain percentage of the total transaction amount in a non-interest bearing reserve for a contractually predetermined amount of time.
It's defined at the account level, and not based on the account holder.

Swan applies rolling reserve to certain types of transactions (largely pull payment methods, such as direct debit and card transactions) to protect users and Swan against various risk factors, such as insufficient funds and attempted fraud.
The reserved amount acts as a safety net to cover potential loss for both Swan and users.

Rolling reserve is expressed as a percentage over a period of time.
For example, assume rolling reserve is 20% of the transaction amount held for 30 business days.
Consider the following example:

> A direct debit transaction for 150€ is made and requires rolling reserve.<br />
Swan reserves, or holds back, 30€ for 30 business days, and 30€ is added to the `Reserved` account balance.<br />After 30 business days, the 30€ is added to the `Available` account balance and can be used.
