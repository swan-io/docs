## New feature

🔎 [Get bank details](/topics/accounts/overview/guide-get-bank-details/) (RIBs) for virtual IBANs with the `account` query.
You can also download them from your Dashboard.
If you use Swan's Web Banking interface, your users can download them from the **Account** > **Virtual IBANs** tab.

## Improvements

🪪 We improved the [sign-up process](/topics/users/#signup) for a smoother user experience.
Now, all users enter their personal information at the beginning.
We also added a review page for users to confirm that their information is correct, helping avoid rejections due to mismatched data.

👥 To improve the granularity of [account membership permissions](/topics/accounts/memberships/#permissions), only account members with `canManageAccountMembership` can view a list of account members.
Previously, those with `canViewAccount` could also view the list.

⛴️ We added new fields to [payment control POST requests](/developers/using-api/payment-control/#swan-request) and card transaction queries: `merchantAcquirerId` and `subMerchantId`.
Start implementing these fields using the [Event Simulator](/developers/tools/event-simulator).
Please note that the `subMerchantId` field will be returned *null* until it's implemented in the upcoming months.

🛡️ One time every 24 hours, your users are now required to [acknowledge a fraud warning](/partnership/protections/fraud/#protect) before consenting to a transfer.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

👥 Starting on **March 20th**, account memberships are only returned in the `accountMemberships` and `account.Memberships` queries if you have the `canManageAccountMembership` [permission](/topics/accounts/memberships/#permissions).

✍ Starting on **April 1st**, the [`registrationNumber` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/onboard-company-account-holder-input/#onboardcompanyaccountholderinputregistrationnumberstring-) becomes mandatory for company onboardings, regardless of country.
This applies to all [onboardings](/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs-company-account-holder) where `companyType` is set to `Company`, and where `companyType` is set to `SelfEmployed` and the account country is `France`.
Additionally, the `isRegistered` parameter will be set to `true` automatically for these onboardings.
Please note that this update doesn't impact capital deposits.
