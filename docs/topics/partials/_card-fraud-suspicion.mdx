:::caution suspicion of fraud
At the slightest suspicion of fraud, block all eCommerce payments temporarily by updating `eCommerce` to `false` for the concerned card product.
Additionally, you can temporarily or permanently [block physical cards](../cards/physical/guide-block-unblock.mdx) and permanently [cancel virtual cards](../cards/virtual/guide-cancel.mdx).

The **cardholder** then needs to [submit a support request](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18444696903837), after which Swan can issue a new card.
