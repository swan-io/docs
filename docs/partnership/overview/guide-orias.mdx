# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Register with Orias

:::caution France-based only
Only companies legally **based in France** need to register with Orias.
:::

## Introduction {#introduction}

Companies based in France operate with the [legal status](../index.mdx#legal-status) **Registered Swan Intermediary**.

This means you'll become an **MOBSP**, or *Mandataire en OpÃ©ration de Banque et en Service de Paiement*.
In English, this translates roughly to *Authorized Bank and Payment Services Intermediaries*.
As an MOBSP, you'll be regulated by **Orias**, an association that approves and monitors insurance, banking, and investment intermediaries in France.

In order to partner with Swan, **you must apply to Orias**.
Swan can't complete this process for you, nor can Swan, at any time, access your personal Orias profile or obtain privileged information about your application.
Note that your part can be done within a few hours, and Swan's within a few days.
After that, Orias can take up to two months to review your application.

Though the process is yours to complete, Swan can help if you need help along the way.
Send an email to support@swan.io if you have questions about the process.

## Step 1: Prepare your information {#info}

### 1.1 Get information from Swan {#info-1}

After signing your partnership contract with Swan, complete the following steps to obtain your *attestation de mandat*, or a mandate certificate.

1. Send an email to compliance@swan.io that includes your **legal name** and **SIREN** number.
1. Swan will reply with your *attestation de mandat* (mandate certificate). You'll need your certificate for step 3.3.

### 1.2 Get valid supporting documents {#info-2}
