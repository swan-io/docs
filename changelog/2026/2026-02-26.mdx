## New features

📅 Set [card spending limits](/topics/cards/#spending-limits) based on **calendar periods** (e.g., resetting monthly on the 1st) instead of only rolling periods (e.g., last 30 days).
Calendar-based limits make it easier for finance teams to control budgets by calendar month, week, or day.
Configure calendar limits using the new `mode` field in [`SpendingLimitInput`](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/spending-limit-input/) with options for `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly` calendar recurrence.

📩 Starting **March 5**, the new white-labelled email notifications will be activated in Production Live.
They've been available to test in Production Sandbox since February 19, so you can anticipate the impact on your KYC operations if you have automation in place.

Affected notifications:

- Your account terms and conditions.
- First transfer.
- Request supporting documents.
- Request supporting documents reminders.
- Your account is opened.
- Join your banking space.

## Improvements

🔐 The sign-in to Web Banking flow on desktop was updated on **February 18**.
Users now receive a 6-digit OTP code via SMS and enter both the code and their passcode on desktop, instead of clicking a link and entering their passcode on mobile.
This update improves security by making it harder for unauthorized users to access accounts.

🔑 We've added [idempotency](/developers/using-api/idempotency) to our Internal Direct Debit and SEPA Direct Debit mutations, so you can more safely accept payments from these payment methods.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ Starting **April 2**, the following [`CloseAccountReasonType`](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/close-account-reason-type/) values will be deprecated to provide more granular reason codes for account opening refusals, capital deposit cancellations, and retroactive account closures:

- `PartnerReason`: use `RequestedByHolder` instead.
- `Inactivity`: use `DormantAccount` instead.
- `CapitalDepositReason`: use any of the new specific reason codes instead.
