# Data protection

Because Swan is a financial institution supervised by the *Banque de France*, Swan has a regulatory requirement to [verify the identity of all users](../../topics/users/identifications/index.mdx).
Your users often verify their identity through a short video of their face, which is a great way for Swan to prevent fraud.

Swan processes and stores these videos with great care.
Videos are encrypted in Swan's systems and stored in European data centers.
User data is never transferred outside of Europe.
Additionally, only Swan teams responsible for verifying identities and teams in charge of compliance with banking regulations can access these videos.

Swan is required by law to keep data for **five years after an [account is closed](../../topics/accounts/closure/index.mdx)**, in accordance with [French banking regulations](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000041577784).
