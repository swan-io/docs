## New features

📩 Starting **March 12**, the new white-labelled email notifications will be activated in Production Live.
Starting today, they're available to test in Production Sandbox, so you can anticipate the impact on your KYC operations if you have automation in place.

Affected notifications:

- Your account terms and conditions.
- First transfer.
- Request supporting documents.
- Request supporting documents reminders.
- Your account is opened.
- Join your banking space.

## Improvements

🔐 The sign-in to Web Banking flow on desktop was updated on **February 18**.
Users now receive a 6-digit OTP code via SMS and enter both the code and their passcode on desktop, instead of clicking a link and entering their passcode on mobile.
This update improves security by making it harder for unauthorized users to access accounts.

🔑 We've added [idempotency](/developers/using-api/idempotency) to our Internal Direct Debit and SEPA Direct Debit mutations, so you can more safely accept payments from these payment methods.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ Starting **April 2**, the following [`CloseAccountReasonType`](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/close-account-reason-type/) values will be deprecated to provide more granular reason codes for account opening refusals, capital deposit cancellations, and retroactive account closures:

- `PartnerReason`: use `RequestedByHolder` instead.
- `Inactivity`: use `DormantAccount` instead.
- `CapitalDepositReason`: use any of the new specific reason codes instead.

### Reminders

🌍 On **March 31**, `accountId` becomes mandatory in [`internationalBeneficiaryDynamicForms`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/international-beneficiary-dynamic-forms/) and [`internationalCreditTransferTransactionDetailsDynamicForm`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/international-credit-transfer-transaction-details-dynamic-form/). It's available now as optional; update your integration before this date.

📆 On **April 1**, the following fields will be removed from [`accountStatement`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/account-statement/), [`Account.statements`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/account/), and [`generateAccountStatement`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/generate-account-statement/):

- `fees`: replaced by `feeCredits` and `feeDebits`.
- `status`: replaced by `statusInfo`.
- `url` in `type`: moved to `statusInfo`.
