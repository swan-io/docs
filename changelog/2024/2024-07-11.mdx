### New features

üí≥ Our first cards are reaching expiration in 2024.
Therefore, we deployed an [automatic renewal process](/topics/cards/physical/#renew) so virtual and physical cards renew automatically before they expire.
Your cardholders can [update their delivery address](/topics/cards/physical/#renew-address) for the new physical card if needed.

Users can now [choose their PIN](/topics/cards/physical/#pin-choose) when printing a physical card.
To allow this for your cardholders, set the new `choosePin` boolean to `true`.
Allowing cardholders to choose their PIN will reduce friction to use their physical card, therefore driving more transactions.

### Improvements

üîé **In 1 week**, we're generating [Bank Details documents](/topics/accounts/#bank-details) for all accounts created before 16 November 2023, which weren't available automatically when we launched this feature.
Subscribe to the `Account.Updated` webhook to synchronize your system if necessary.

üåê Choose and update the [account membership language](/topics/accounts/memberships/#language), used for the invitation email and when ordering and using cards.

- By default, the new `AccountMembership.language` inherits the `Account.language` chosen during onboarding.
- The available languages are: Dutch `nl`, English `en`, French `fr`, German `de`, Italian `it`, Portuguese `pt`, and Spanish `es`.
- Finnish `fi` isn't supported for the account membership language yet.
- If you're subscribed to the `AccountMembership.Updated` webhook, you'll receive a webhook notification when `AccountMembership.language` is live.
- If you've already used the `updateAccountMembership` mutation to choose the language for an account membership, the language won't change with this update.

### Upcoming breaking changes

‚ö†Ô∏è In **4 weeks**, we're adding new values to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` and `SupportingDocumentType` enums.

- **`SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum**: `PersonalIncome`, `PersonalSavings`, `Investment`, `Donation`, `Inheritance`, `RealEstateIncome`, `GamblingPrizeWinnings`, `Trade`, `CompanyTreasury`, and `CompanyObligations`
- **`SupportingDocumentType` enum**: `WinningsCertificate` and `Invoice`
