## New features

💳 [**Payment Control**](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/payment-control/) now supports €0 authorizations and credit authorizations, identifiable with [`TransactionSide!`](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/transaction-side/) as `Credit`. Activate this feature from your **Dashboard** > **Developers** > **Payment control**.

🔑 **Idempotency** is now available for `initiateCreditTransfers`. Add an [idempotency key](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/idempotency/#idempotency-key-requirements) to your transfer queries to improve reliability and prevent duplicate transactions.

📥 You can now [export transaction data](<!--/topics/payments/overview/guide-export/-->) in `.csv` format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportTransactionData` mutation.

## Improvements

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 [**Server-to-server consent**](https://docs.swan.io/topics/users/consent/#s2s) is now available for all account membership [mutations](https://docs.swan.io/topics/users/consent/#sensitive), enabling you to reduce manual operations and scale more easily.

🔢 A new `Service` section is now available in your **Dashboard** > **Insights**. This section provides essential data on your KYC and Transaction Monitoring operations, including processing volumes and SLA performance. Related metrics have been moved from the Onboarding section to centralize this information.
