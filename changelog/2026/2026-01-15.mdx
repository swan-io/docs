## Improvements

📄 The [`generateTransactionStatement` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/generate-transaction-statement/) now works for incoming and outgoing `Booked` [International Credit Transfers](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/international/). Use it to [prove a transaction was executed](/topics/payments/overview/guide-generate-transaction-statement/) by Swan.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🌍 Starting January 19, a new `accountId` field is available as an optional parameter in [`internationalBeneficiaryDynamicForms`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/international-beneficiary-dynamic-forms/) and [`internationalCreditTransferTransactionDetailsDynamicForm`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/international-credit-transfer-transaction-details-dynamic-form/). This field becomes mandatory on March 31, 2026. Update your integration before this date to ensure continued support for international credit transfer queries.

### Reminders

📆 On **April 1**, the following fields will be removed from the [`accountStatement`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/account-statement/) and [`Account.statements`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/account/) queries and from the [`generateAccountStatement`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/generate-account-statement/) mutation response:

- `fees` will be replaced by `feeCredits` and `feeDebits`.
- `status` will be replaced by the `statusInfo` object.
- The statement download `url`, previously in the `type` object, will only be available in `statusInfo`.
