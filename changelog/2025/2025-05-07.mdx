## New features

📥 You can now [export account data](/topics/accounts/overview/guide-export) in `.csv` format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportAccountData` mutation.

## Improvements

🪪 `Auto` [identification](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user/#url-parameters-optional) is now smoother. To automatically skip the identification process for eligible users on projects configured to bypass it, add the `accountMembershipId` to the authorization URL when inviting account members. 

🤏 To protect you and the merchant from fraud, merchant payments may now have a `paymentAmountLimit` that applies to each individual transaction. 
This [limit](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/webhooks/#events-funding) may be applied during the review of the merchant payment method or later, based on risk factors. 
It's available in the `merchantPaymentMethod` type in the API, for [Card](/topics/merchants/online/cards/#payment-limit), [SEPA Direct Debit](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/#payment-limit) (Core and B2B), and [French check](/topics/merchants/online/checks/#payment-limit) payments. 
Setting a limit will trigger a `MerchantPaymentMethod.Updated` webhook.
