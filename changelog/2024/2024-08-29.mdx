### Improvements

👤 In order to reduce [user binding errors](/topics/accounts/memberships/#binding-errors) when adding account memberships, we now consider the account member's `birthLastName`. If it matches their `lastName`, we won't raise a `lastNameMatchError`.

🧭 [Enriched transaction information](/topics/payments/cards/#enriched) is now available for all card transactions, including those from the start of Swan. When available, detailed merchant and transaction data can be accessed through the API, Dashboard, and Web Banking.

📄 [Get information about supporting documents](/topics/accounts/documents/guide-get-info/#guide-onboarding) related to **onboarding** and **account holder verification** from your Dashboard. We also revamped the document collection portal.

👯 Access and change the Sandbox user you're [impersonating](/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-impersonate) when using Web Banking in the Sandbox environment.

### Breaking changes

💳 As announced on [August 1](/changelog/1-august-2024), we now use additional issued card [rejection reason codes](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/rejected-reason-code/): `CanceledByCardHolder`, `DigitalCardDeactivated`, `DigitalCardEnrollmentInvalid`, `DigitalCardRefusal`, `DigitalCardSuspended`, `DigitalCardTokenInvalid`, `InPersonTransactionsNotAuthorized`, `MagstripeNotSupported`, `MerchantNotFound`, `PeriodTransactionNumberLimitExceeded`, `PinRequired`, and `ThreeDsError`.

### Upcoming breaking changes

🔢 In **4 weeks**, we're introducing a [webhook subscription limit](/developers/using-api/webhooks#subscription-limits). In order to avoid overconsumption caused by too many subscriptions to the same event, you'll be restricted to 10 subscriptions per Sandbox event and 5 subscriptions per Live event.

⚠️ In **4 weeks**, we're adding a new value to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` Enum: `PepDeclaration`.

⛔ In **8 weeks**, if you call the API with a [user access token](/developers/using-api/authentication/#tokens-user) attributed to a `Blocked` user, it will be rejected.
