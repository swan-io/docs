# Accounts

Use Swan accounts to receive and initiate payments, as well as deposit money.
All money moves through accounts, so if you're using Swan, you're using an account.

Swan accounts are based **in euros (€)** and are represented by an IBAN and a name.
Get information about the account with the `account` query, and update information such as the name with the `updateAccount` [mutation](https://explorer.swan.io?query=bXV0YXRpb24gQ2hhbmdlTGFuZ3VhZ2UgewogIHVwZGF0ZUFjY291bnQoCiAgICBpbnB1dDogeyBhY2NvdW50SWQ6ICIkWU9VUl9BQ0NPVU5UX0lEIiwgbmFtZTogIiRORVdfQUNDT1VOVF9OQU1FIiB9CiAgKSB7CiAgICAuLi4gb24gVXBkYXRlQWNjb3VudFN1Y2Nlc3NQYXlsb2FkIHsKICAgICAgX190eXBlbmFtZQogICAgICBhY2NvdW50IHsKICAgICAgICBuYW1lCiAgICAgICAgdXBkYXRlZEF0CiAgICAgIH0KICAgIH0KICB9Cn0K&tab=api).

:::info Creating accounts
Accounts, along with [account holders](../onboarding/account-holders/index.mdx), are created during the [account onboarding](../onboarding/index.mdx) process.
:::

## Account country {#account-country}

You **choose your account's country** during the **onboarding** process.
The account country then determines IBAN country codes.
For example, consider the sample mutation to [create an individual onboarding link](../onboarding/individual/guide-create.mdx#mutation).
The account country chosen on line 4 is France (`accountCountry: FRA`).
All IBANs associated with this account have the prefix `FR`.

Swan offers the following account countries:

import AccountCountryList from "../partials/_account-countries.mdx";

<AccountCountryList />

### Resident and non-resident accounts {#account-country-residence}

The account country **isn't always** the country where the account holder resides.
Your users can have a Swan account if they live anywhere in the European Union, as Swan allows accounts for both residents and non-residents of supported account countries.

- **Resident account**: The account holder lives in the account country.
- **Non-resident account**: The account holder lives outside the account country. These accounts often require reporting as a foreign account to the account holder's local tax authority.

:::caution Thorough account holder review
Opening accounts is subject to a [thorough verification](../onboarding/account-holders/index.mdx#verifying-account-holders), regardless of residence or account country.
:::

## Account language {#language}

Choose the account language when creating onboarding links for [individuals](../onboarding/individual/guide-create.mdx) and [companies](../onboarding/company/guide-create.mdx).
Swan uses the account language for all **official documents** and **communications**.

After the account is created, you can change the account language with the `updateAccount` [mutation](https://explorer.swan.io?query=bXV0YXRpb24gQ2hhbmdlTGFuZ3VhZ2UgewogIHVwZGF0ZUFjY291bnQoaW5wdXQ6IHsgYWNjb3VudElkOiAiJFlPVVJfQUNDT1VOVF9JRCIsIGxhbmd1YWdlOiBkZSB9KSB7CiAgICAuLi4gb24gVXBkYXRlQWNjb3VudFN1Y2Nlc3NQYXlsb2FkIHsKICAgICAgX190eXBlbmFtZQogICAgICBhY2NvdW50IHsKICAgICAgICBsYW5ndWFnZQogICAgICB9CiAgICB9CiAgfQp9Cg%3D%3D&tab=api).
If you're using Swan's Web Banking interface, account holders can change the language themselves.

## Balances {#balances}

Accounts at Swan are designed for credit balances only.
Swan account balances can **never go below zero**, meaning Swan rejects outgoing payments if the account's `Available` balance isn't sufficient to cover the total payment amount.
The only exception is the automatic [billing of banking fees](./billing/index.mdx#fees-swan-standard).

There are four different account balances.

|   Balance   | Includes                                                                                                                                                                                         | Equal to                                                                          |
| :---------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `Booked`   | Transactions that are already debited or credited                                                                                                                                                | Sum of all `Booked` transactions                                                  |
|  `Pending`  | Transactions that were authorized but haven't been debited or credited yet                                                                                                                       | Sum of all `Pending` transactions                                                 |
| `Reserved`  | Transactions that require [rolling reserve](../../glossary.mdx#rolling-reserve) according to the policy for that payment method<br /><br />`Reserved` amount is included in the `Booked` balance | Sum of all `Booked` transactions for which the funds are still in rolling reserve |
| `Available` | Balance that is actually available to be used                                                                                                                                                    | `Booked` - (`Pending` + `Reserved`)                                               |

<h3 id="example-insufficient-funds">Example: Insufficient funds</h3>

This example involves the balances `Booked`, `Pending`, and `Available`.

1. An account has a `Booked` balance of 142€.
1. There is a `Pending` outgoing transfer request for 42€ that is still being processed. Therefore, the `Available` balance is 100€ (142€ - 42€ = 100€).
1. This account doesn't have a sufficient balance to send an outgoing payment of more than its 100€ `Available` balance. Therefore, the payment is **rejected**.

<h3 id="example-rolling-reserve">Example: Rolling reserve</h3>

This example involves the balances `Booked`, `Reserved`, and `Available`.

1. A merchant's account has a `Booked` balance of 200€ thanks to [accepting a customer's payment](../merchants/sdd/index.mdx) through SEPA Direct Debit.
1. For this example, the rolling reserve is 15% over 15 business days (exact rolling reserve amounts can change based on your contract with Swan). Therefore, the `Reserved` balance is 30€ for 15 days.
1. The `Available` balance from this transaction is 170€ for the duration of the rolling reserve period (200€ - 30€ = 170€).
1. After 15 days, the `Reserved` balance is released and the full `Available` balance is 200€.

## Transactions {#transactions}

An account is essentially a list of transactions, and transactions directly impact account balances.

There are six possible statuses for Swan transactions.
Each payment method uses a **different combination** of these statuses with specific flows.
Refer to the schemas for [credit transfers](../payments/credit-transfers/index.mdx#statuses), [direct debits](../payments/direct-debit/index.mdx#statuses), and [cards](../payments/cards/index.mdx#statuses) for more information about statuses for that payment method.

import TransactionStatuses from "../partials/_transaction-statuses.mdx";

<TransactionStatuses />

## Account documents {#documents}

### Account statements {#statements}

Each month, Swan **generates account statements** automatically for **all Swan accounts**.
Statements include all `Booked` transactions from the previous month.
Access account statements with the API, from your Dashboard, or, if you're using it, Swan's Web Banking interface.

Account statements are available in `.pdf` or `.csv` format by default.
Statements with more than 10,000 transactions are generated as `.csv` files, even if you request `.pdf`.

Account statements are accessible by calling the `account` query and adding the `statement` object.

#### Custom statements {#statements-custom}

You can also access the raw data and **generate custom statements**.
For example, you might need a format Swan doesn't provide, or you might want customize the style.

As a regulated financial institution, account statements fall under compliance rules, and you might need to **get your custom statements approved**. Please work with your dedicated Technical Account Manager before releasing a custom statements.

Note that even if you use custom statements, Swan generates statements each month.
If audited, Swan's account statement is the official version.

### Bank details {#bank-details}

You can get a PDF containing your bank details using the API.
In French, this document is called a **RIB**, or a _relevé d'identité bancaire_.

For all accounts created after 16 November 2023, the PDF is generated automatically after the account's main IBAN is assigned, meaning the account must have the payment level `Unlimited` and the account type `Payment Services`.
Note that the automatic generation might take a few minutes.
The document is generated in the account language.

If an account's bank details PDF wasn't generated automatically, you can [trigger the API](./overview/guide-get-bank-details.mdx).

Bank detail PDFs include:

1. Your logo.
1. Account's main IBAN.
1. Bank code.
1. Your company's information.
1. Disclaimer: "In partnership with Swan".
   - The disclaimer is required because [Swan assumes responsibility](../../partnership/index.mdx#license) for all sensitive banking operations. It's similar to the [statement printed on physical cards](../cards/design/index.mdx#standard) indicating that cards are issued by Swan.
1. Title of the document.
1. BIC/SWIFT code.
1. Account holder's information.

| `Closed`    | For all `Closed` accounts, access and account statements remain available for one year through the API or with Swan's Web Banking interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

:::caution Remaining funds in Closing account ∗
As long as the `Booked` balance doesn't equal zero:

1. The account status can't pass from `Closing` to `Closed`.
1. The account holder can still log into their Swan Web Banking interface.
1. The account holder can send SEPA Credit Transfers.

If funds remain in a `Closing` account **after 10 years**, Swan transfers the funds to France's _Caisse des dépôts et consignations_ (Deposits and Consignments Fund).
