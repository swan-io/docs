When an invited account member isnt' a Swan user, they'll need to provide some additional information.


When your invited account member accepts the account membership, they might be asked to provide some additional information when they connect for the first time.


1. The invited account member opens the URL. If prompted, they enter their mobile phone number.
    - If already on their **mobile device**, they'll receive a verification code to enter when prompted.
    - If on a **computer**, they'll receive a text message with a link. They need to open the link and continue the process on their mobile device.
1. If the invited account member isn't already a Swan user, they'll complete a few steps before consenting:
    - Enter their personal information: first/given name, last/family name, and birth date. This information must match the information providing in the API call to add a new account member.
    - Choose a 6-digit passcode they'll need to enter occasionally during the [consent process](../../consent/index.mdx).
    - Optionally, they can also enable biometrics.
    - New Swan users must also perform identity verification, which can be performed later.
1. Finally, the invited account member follows the prompts on their mobile device to consent to becoming an account member.
