# Query account closure information

Retrieve closure reason codes and closure dates for accounts with the status `Closing` or `Closed` using the API.

## Query structure {#query}

When an account has the status `Closing` or `Closed`, the `statusInfo` field returns either `AccountClosingStatus` or `AccountClosedStatus`.
Both types include a `reasonInfo` object with the closure reason `type`.

- `AccountClosingStatus` includes `closingAt`: the date the account entered the `Closing` status.
- `AccountClosedStatus` includes both `closingAt` and `closedAt`: the dates the account entered each status.

Refer to the [closure reason codes](./index.mdx#closure-reason-codes) for a full list of possible values.

## Example query {#example-query}

Use the following query to retrieve closure information for a specific account.

        reasonInfo {
          ... on CloseAccountReason {
            type
          }
        }
        closingAt
      }
      ... on AccountClosedStatus {
        reasonInfo {
          ... on CloseAccountReason {
            type
          }
        }
        closingAt
        closedAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example payload {#payload}

The following example shows a response for an account closed because the account holder requested it.
