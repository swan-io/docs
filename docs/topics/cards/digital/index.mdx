**Digital cards** *<DigitalCardsDefinition />*

***

Swan cards are compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay.

If you choose to allow digital cards, your cardholders can add virtual and physical cards to their preferred digital wallet.
A list of digital cards is available in the `cards` query.

## Certifying your digital card integration {#integration}

You need to certify your digital card integration before your cardholders can use Apple Pay and Google Pay.

Send an email to integration@swan.io specifying that you'd like to activate in-app provisioning for digital payments.
The team will help you get started.

## Adding cards to digital wallets {#wallets}

Only [enabled virtual cards](../virtual/index.mdx#statuses) and [activated physical cards](../physical/index.mdx#statuses) can be digitized.
Virtual cards are enabled almost immediately, but make sure your cardholders activate their physical cards before trying to digitize them.

There are multiple ways to [add cards to a digital wallet](./guide-add.mdx):

1. Your cardholders can do it themselves by entering their virtual or physical card number into the digital wallet.
1. Your cardholders can use the Swan App and follow the in-app provisioning process.
1. You can initiate the in-app provisioning process through the `addDigitalCard` mutation.

## Renewing digital cards {#auto-renew}

Swan takes care of updating digital cards with Apple Pay and Google Pay.
It's a clear advantage, as this requires no action from you nor your client.
