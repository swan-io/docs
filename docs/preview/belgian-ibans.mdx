# Belgian IBANs

Issue local Belgian IBANs for your account holders and members, providing enhanced banking experience and regulatory compliance for Belgian users.

## Overview

Offering Belgian IBANs expands Swan's local IBAN coverage, allowing you to offer familiar local banking experiences to end-users. Account holders registered in Belgium will receive Belgian IBANs (with a `BE` prefix) instead of French IBANs.

### Key benefits

- **Expanded market reach**: Serve Belgian customers with local banking infrastructure.
- **Regulatory alignment**: Meet Belgian banking regulations and reporting requirements.
- **Enhanced user trust**: Local IBANs increase customer confidence and reduce payment friction.
- **Local banking integration**: Seamless integration with Belgian banking systems and practices.

## Geographic scope

Belgian IBANs are available for:
- **Account holders** registered in Belgium.
- **Account members** in Swan-supported European markets.
- **Business accounts** for Belgian companies and subsidiaries.

## Integration impact

Belgian IBAN support maintains full compatibility with existing Swan integrations:

- **No breaking changes**: Existing API calls continue to work.
- **Standard onboarding flow**: Uses existing individual and company onboarding processes.
- **Consistent permissions**: Account membership permissions work identically across all local IBANs.
