# Tools overview

One of Swan's goals is to provide a Sandbox, or test environment that's as close as possible to your Live environment.

In addition to your **Dashboard**, several key tools work together in harmony to help you test your integration:

- [API Explorer](./api-explorer.mdx)
- [Testing API](./testing-api.mdx)
- [Event Simulator](./event-simulator.mdx)
- [Sandbox users](./sandbox-users.mdx)
- [Postman collection](./postman-collection.mdx) *(optional)*

Use these tools to test scenarios manually, test behavior before implementation, simulate operations with the API, and more.
You can also call the Testing API programmatically and perform end-to-end tests without connecting to the Dashboard.
