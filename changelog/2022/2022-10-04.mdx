### New features

⚡ We can now receive [Instant SEPA Credit Transfers](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa)! These will be shown as `SepaInstantCreditTransferIn` in the `TransactionTypeEnum`.

💳 Manage [multiple card products](/topics/cards) from the dashboard, with different designs and spending limits.

### Improvements

💳 Order cards from the web banking with all our API capabilities: card design, format (Virtual, Physical or Single Use), spending settings, one or multiple members, grouped or individual delivery.

📅 The Rolling Reserve for B2B `SepaDirectDebitIn` transactions in an Account Funding context has been decreased from 4 to 3 inter-bank business days + the booking date/time for SDD-In transactions was changed from 6PM CET to 8PM CET.

🚥 [Funding Sources are no longer suspended](/topics/accounts/funding) when a rejection is received for `SepaDirectDebitIn` within the B2B scheme created for Account Funding. When a rejection is received for `InsufficientFunds`, core scheme Funding Sources won't be suspended either. This can be simulated via the testing API and by adding a `reasonCode` in the `simulateIncomingSepaDirectDebitReject` and `simulateIncomingSepaDirectDebitReturn` API mutations.

🗓️ We've removed the [14 calendar day limitation](/topics/accounts/funding) on the `requestedExecutionAt` for `initiateFundingRequest`. When the `requestedExecutionAt` input is used, `SEPADirectDebitIn` transactions created with `Upcoming` status can now be canceled up to 1 day before the `executionDate` and 1 hour before Swan cut-off.

### Bug fix

💥 A very small proportion of users experienced errors when using their 6-digit passcode during consent. This has been fixed.

### Breaking changes

👥 The hierarchy of Membership rights has been updated: A member cannot give permissions to others, that they don't themselves have. We will keep you posted on the new rejection that will occur in case this happens.

### Upcoming breaking changes

📅 By the end of October, the deprecated field `executionDateused` as an input for the `intitiateCreditTransfer` mutation will be permanently removed and replaced by `requestedExecutionAt`.
