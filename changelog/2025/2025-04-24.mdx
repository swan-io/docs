## New features

💳 You can now [set a preferred shipping provider](/topics/cards/physical/#shipping-methods) for physical cards, when calling the `addCards` mutation.
To do this, select `shippingProvider` in the `physicalCardCustomOptions` input.

📥 You can now [export account membership data](/topics/accounts/memberships/guide-export) in `.csv` format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportAccountMembershipData` mutation.

## Improvements

🧭 We improved the `executionDate` field for card transactions.
It now shows the precise timestamp from Mastercard, giving you additional visibility on the time when the transaction was received by the network.

🔎 We've released several updates to improve your Dashboard:

- You can now apply new filters to the following Dashboard pages:
    - Accounts: `IBAN`
    - Account memberships: `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName`
    - Account holders: `firstName` and `lastName`
    - Onboarding: `email`
    - Users: `firstName` and `lastName`
- We've increased the size of the search bar, making it easier to view and input text.
- The search bar now automatically removes unwanted spaces from your input, ensuring more accurate results.

## Update

🧾 Starting May 1, invoices will be issued through our new billing provider, Lago.
The format will change, but the content will remain the same.
