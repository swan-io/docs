## New features

📥 You can now [export account holder data](/topics/onboarding/account-holders/guide-export/) in `.csv` format, either from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportAccountHolderData` mutation.

## Improvements

👤 To provide a seamless experience when users change their own phone numbers, updating `Enabled` account members' personal details won't trigger [user binding errors](/topics/accounts/memberships/#binding-errors) anymore.

💰 To avoid unnecessary debt collection, [fee transactions](/topics/accounts/billing/#fees-swan) are only `Booked` when there's enough money in an account.
When accounts have an insufficient balance, the fee transaction remains `Pending` until more funds are added.

💳 Canceling cards is now fully asynchronous to improve system performance.
As a result, when you cancel a [physical](/topics/cards/physical/#statuses) or [virtual](/topics/cards/virtual/#statuses) card, the status always changes to `Canceling` before `Canceled`.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ Effective from **March 10th**, consent notification API requests to your endpoint time out after 2 seconds instead of 3, in order to comply with 3-D Secure (3DS) requirements.
