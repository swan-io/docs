  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

üí≥ On **October 16th**, the `CardUrl` field will be removed. This field is being deprecated. Use `cardMaskedNumber`, `expiryDate`, and `cardDesignUrl` instead.

üõí On **October 16th**, the following [merchant profiles and merchant payment methods](/topics/merchants/) breaking changes will take effect:

- A new `WaitingForInformation` status and `verificationRequirements` list will be available for merchant profiles and merchant payment methods to communicate missing information. These requirements must be provided at the merchant profile level using the `requestMerchantProfile` and `requestMerchantProfileUpdate` mutations. 
- A new `supportingDocumentCollections` field will also be available at the merchant profile level for providing required documents.
- The fields `invoiceExample`, `expectedMonthlyPaymentVolume`, `merchantWebsite`, `socialNetwork`, `supportWebsite`, `termsAndConditions` will be **removed** from the API.
- `rejectReasons` will be removed for card payment methods.
- `rejectionReasons` for `Rejected` merchant profiles and Merchant Payment Methods will become mandatory in the Testing APIs `simulateMerchantProfileRequestOutcome` and `simulateMerchantPaymentMethodRequestOutcome`.
- Dynamic rolling reserve changes and maximum payment amount limits will be introduced at the merchant payment method level to mitigate risk. Subscribe to the `MerchantPaymentMethod.Created` and `MerchantPaymentMethod.Updated` webhooks for these updates.

üí∏ Effective **October 19th**, we're introducing the following updates to the `initiateCreditTransfers` endpoint to improve its usability and clarity:

- The `save` parameter will default to `false`.
- The `mode` parameter will be a **required** field. The default value is set to `Regular`.
- The `isMyOwnIban` and `beneficiaryId` input fields will be **removed**.
- The API will return a `ValidationRejection` error instead of `ForbiddenRejection` when an input contains **invalid** data.

‚úîÔ∏è Starting **October 31st**, the `beneficiaryVerification` query will be deprecated. Use the `verifyBeneficiary` mutation instead to ensure uninterrupted service.

‚öñÔ∏è Starting **October 31st**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be a mandatory field at onboarding when an account holder's residency country does not match the `accountCountry`. This is to comply with [CRS (Common Reporting Standard) regulations](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf).

üîç Starting **November 12th**, the `onboarding(id: ID!)` query may return `null` when no onboarding exists for the given ID, instead of always returning an `Onboarding` object.

üîÑ On **November 12th**, the `verificationFlow` field will be removed from the `OnboardingInfo` object. This field is deprecated and no longer serves any purpose.

üîó On **November 12th**, the `redirectUrl` field will be removed from both the `Onboarding` and `OnboardingInfo` objects. It has been deprecated for two years and replaced by the `oauthRedirectParameters` object.

üë§ On **November 12th**, the `title` field will be removed from the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) object. It has been deprecated and replaced by the `gender` field.

üìä On **November 12th**, the `onboardingState` field will be removed from the `OnboardingInfo` object. This field is deprecated and no longer serves any purpose.

üí• Starting **December 31st**, the `bookedBalanceAfter` field will be removed from the transaction query. Use the `balanceAfter.amount` on `BookedTransactionStatusInfo` instead.
