  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

‚ö†Ô∏è Starting **October 1st**, we're removing the `paymentId` field from the `initiateSepaDirectDebitMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Instead, retrieve the ID from the `merchantPayment` field, which now returns the Merchant Payment object.

üìñ Starting **October 9th**, the new **[Verification of Payee](https://docs.swan.io/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/verification-of-payee/)** regulation takes effect.

‚ö†Ô∏è Starting **October 31st**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be mandatory at onboarding when the `accountCountry` and the account holder's residency address country don't match, due to [CRS regulation](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf) requirements.

üë• Starting **December 31st**, the `bookedBalanceAfter` field will be removed from the transaction query. Please use the `balanceAfter.amount` on `BookedTransactionStatusInfo`.
