  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

‚ö†Ô∏è Starting **October 1st**, we're removing the `paymentId` field from the `initiateSepaDirectDebitMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Instead, retrieve the ID from the `merchantPayment` field, which now returns the Merchant Payment object.

üìñ Starting **October 9th**, the new **[Verification of Payee](/preview/verification-of-payee/)** regulation takes effect.

‚ö†Ô∏è Starting **October 31, 2025**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be a mandatory field at onboarding when an account holder's residency country does not match the `accountCountry`. This is to comply with [CRS (Common Reporting Standard) regulations](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf).

üë• Starting **December 31st**, the `bookedBalanceAfter` field will be removed from the transaction query. Please use the `balanceAfter.amount` on `BookedTransactionStatusInfo`.
