# Upload required documents

:::caution Multi-step process
This page explains how to upload documents for steps 4 and 8 of a **multi-step process**.
Refer to the [France guide](./guide.mdx) for the whole process.
:::

## Step 1: Generate upload URL  {#generate-url}

Use the `generateCapitalDepositDocumentUploadUrl` mutation to generate an upload URL.

1. Call the `generateCapitalDepositDocumentUploadUrl` mutation.
1. Enter all required information: `documentId`,`capitalDepositCaseId`, and `filename`.
1. Add the `GenerateSupportingDocumentUploadUrlSuccessPayload` with the `uploadUrl`.
1. Add other optional messages to the payload, either for validation or in case of rejection.

ðŸ”Ž [Open the mutation in API Explorer](https://explorer.swan.io)

```graphql {2,4-6,10} showLineNumbers
mutation MyMutation {
  generateCapitalDepositDocumentUploadUrl(
    input: {
      documentId: "$YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID"
      capitalDepositCaseId: "$YOUR_CAPITALDEPOSITCASE_ID"
      filename: "$FILE_NAME"
    }
  ) {
    ... on GenerateCapitalDepositDocumentUploadUrlSuccessPayload {
      uploadUrl
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Retrieve generated URL from payload {#retrieve-url}

Retrieve the generated `uploadUrl` in the payload.

:::caution Upload URL expires
The `uploadUrl` is **only valid for seven days**, after which you'd need to generate a new URL.
:::

```graphql {4} showLineNumbers
{
  "data": {
    "generateCapitalDepositDocumentUploadUrl": {
      "uploadUrl": "$YOUR_UPLOAD_URL"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Send HTTP PUT request {#send-http-request}

Send an HTTP PUT request to the `uploadUrl` with a `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` header.

**Supported formats**: `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`

```curl showLineNumbers
curl --upload-file $YOUR_FILE https://$UPLOAD_URL
```

## Step 4: Repeat {#repeat-steps}

Repeat steps 1-3 to upload additional documents, as needed.
You can also change the documents you already uploaded as long as the [document status](../index.mdx#documents-statuses) remains `Uploaded`.
