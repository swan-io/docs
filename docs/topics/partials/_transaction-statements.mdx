Your users might need to provide a document to a third party showing they initiated a transaction.
Transaction statements confirm that the transaction was executed by Swan, but they don't provide proof that a transaction was completed successfully.
The beneficiary's bank can reject a transaction after Swan executes it.

You can [generate transaction statements](../payments/overview/guide-generate-transaction-statement.mdx) for `Booked` transactions with the API.
After the statement is generated successfully,  you receive a `TransactionStatement.Generated` [webhook notification](../../developers/using-api/webhooks.mdx#events-transactions).

When you receive the webhook notification, query the API to retrieve the URL to download the statement.
You have seven days to download the statement before the link expires.
