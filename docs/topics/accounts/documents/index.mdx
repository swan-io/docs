# Supporting documents

import SupportingDocumentCollectionDefinition from '../../definitions/_supporting-documents.mdx';

> <SupportingDocumentCollectionDefinition />

## Overview {#overview}

Swan is sometimes required to collect documents to verify **account holders** and **transaction details**.

Each **document** is uploaded individually into a **collection**.
After all required documents are uploaded, Swan **reviews the collection**.

Supporting document **collections are empty when created**.
Swan can upload some documents, and you can add documents to these collections as requested.
For each required document, you'll create a document within the collection.

### Options for collecting documents {#collect-documents}

There are two primary options to collect required supporting documents:

| Option | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Use the API**<br /><br />✅ Recommended | <ol><li>No emails are exchanged.</li><li>You'll know every time a document is needed with webhook notifications.</li><li>You communicate with your end users to gather the required documents.</li><li>Choose the API or the Dashboard for most actions, including uploading documents.</li></ol> |
| Email communication | <ol><li>Swan communicates directly with you or your end users.</li><li>You or your end user receives an email.</li><li>When Swan emails your end users directly, you can be copied (CCd) on the email. Let a member of the Swan team know to save this preference.</li></ol> |

### Required documents {#required-documents}

Documents might be required to support verifying an account holder or proving the validity of a transaction.
The documents required vary significantly depending on why Swan needs to collect the documents, where your users are located, whether they're onboarding as individuals or companies, and more.

Refer to the API Reference for a list of [possible supporting document purpose Enums](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/supporting-document-purpose-enum/).

:::info Onboarding tip
For a better user experience, always include a [list of required documents](../../onboarding/overview/guide-get-list.mdx) in your onboarding flows.

## Statuses {#statuses}

Collections and documents have unique statuses.

### Collection statuses {#collection-statuses}

```

| Collection status | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `Waiting for document` | Onboarding is created and ready for documents, or documents were submitted but Swan is requesting additional documents<br/><br/>**Next step**: moves to `Pending review` after onboarding is finalized |
| `Pending review` | Onboarding is finalized and a document review is needed<br/><br/>**Next step**: Can move to `Approved`, `Rejected`, or `Canceled` depending on partner actions and Swan decisions (or, if documents are insufficient → `Waiting for document`) |
| `Approved` | Swan approved the supporting document collection |
| `Rejected` | Swan rejected the supporting document collection |
| `Canceled` | Swan canceled the supporting document collection (this could also be at the partner's request) |

| Document status | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `Waiting for upload` | URL to upload the document has been generated<br/><br/>**Next step**:<br/><ul><li>If the document is uploaded → `Uploaded`</li><li>If the collection switches to a final status before the document is uploaded → `Not uploaded`</li></ul> |
| `Uploaded` | Document is uploaded; if a review is completed on the uploaded document, the status moves to `Validated`, `Refused`, or `Deleted` depending on Partner actions and Swan decisions |
| `Validated` | Swan approved the document |
| `Refused` | Swan refused the document (more information in next section) |
| `Deleted` | Swan or the partner deleted the document |
