### New features

📈 Display your customers' data on the dashboard. This is a great first round; the next release will feature even more data with added filters and a search field.

💳 Cardholders can now [activate a card](/topics/cards/physical/guide-activate) after receiving it, thanks to the new `activatePhysicalCard` mutation. They just have to input the identifier printed on the card and give their consent.

📃 [Upload supporting documents](/topics/accounts/documents/guide-upload) using the `generateSupportingDocumentUploadUrl` mutation during the onboarding. This way you don't have to ask users a second time by email.

### Improvements

🛒 To facilitate the interpretation of the `merchantCategoryCode`, you can now get the description of each code in the `merchantCategoryDescription` field for every `transaction` of `CardTransactiontype`.

### Bug fix

💵 The amounts displayed in `thecard.spending.amount.value` field are now more consistent. Values previously returned as `0` will now be returned as `0.00`

### Breaking changes

👩🏻‍💻 To update the verification status of an individual account holder, you have two options:

- From the dashboard using the event simulator for Update Account Holder (instead of the sandbox users page).
- From the Testing API with the `updateAccountHolder` mutation (instead of `updateSandboxUser`)

📉 We've decided to reduce the number of cards we can issue using `addCards` mutation up to 250 while we fix a performance issue.

### Upcoming breaking changes

💳 Please note that after the next release (estimated for April 7th), the physical card `identifier` will return `null` if its status is `ToActivate`.
