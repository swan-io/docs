# Identifications

Swan users need to **prove their identities** at two key points during their user journey: during [account onboarding](../../onboarding/index.mdx), and if they need to reset their password.
To facilitate the process, Swan provides **secure identification options** using live video and artificial intelligence.

:::note Removing identifications
For users with non-sensitive access to accounts, defined by their [account membership permissions](../../accounts/memberships/index.mdx#remove-identification), identification might not be necessary in some B2B situations.
:::

## Overview {#overview}

Users can complete their identification at any timeâ€”24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
After starting the identification process, users have 10 minutes to finish before the process times out.

Identification typically involves users **presenting an identity document** and **recording their face** in order to validate the following elements:

1. Is the identity document authentic?
1. Is this person real?
1. Does the face presented actually match the identity document?

Note that users must log into Swan to access the identification process.

### Encourage identification {#encourage}

Your users have the option to complete their identification when [signing up](../index.mdx#signup) for Swan, which is part of the onboarding process.
Swan also sends your users a text message with a link they can use to start the process.
The link can only be opened once time.
If you're using Swan's provided **Web Banking** interface, your users can also start their identification from the app.

If your users aren't completing their identification despite these automated efforts, you can encourage them by sending an authentication link:

1. Follow the [guide to get a user access token](../../../developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user.mdx#auth-code).
1. In step 2.1, add the `idverified` parameter to the `scope` (line 9; also includes `openid` and `offline`).

## Identification processes {#processes}

Swan offers three identification processes.
The process your users are required to complete depends on the type of account and location.

1. **Expert**
1. **QES** (Qualified Electronic Signature)
1. **PVID** (Prestataires de vÃ©rification d'identitÃ© Ã  distance)
    - In English: *Remote Identity Verification Service Providers*

There is a hierarchy between identification processes, meaning some processes can award more than one identification level.
Identification processes and levels have the **same names** within Swan's API.
For example:

- The PVID process is stronger than the Expert process. When a user successfully completes the PVID process, they're awarded both PVID and Expert identification levels.
- The QES process is stronger than the Expert process. When a user successfully completes the QES process, they're awarded both QES and Expert identification levels.

To start an identification, follow the [guide to get a user access token](../../../developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user.mdx#auth-code).

### Expert {#expert}

Expert requires a manual, asynchronous review by an expert in identifications.
It can be used to verify an account holder's legal representative as well as account memberships.

### QES {#qes}

Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) confirms who created an identity document, *and* that the document hasn't been altered since being signed.
If both elements are confirmed, QES validates the authenticity and integrity of the document.
Then, the user signs Swan's Terms and Conditions.

Qualified electronic signatures are compliant with [EU Regulation No 910/2014](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG) ([eIDAS Regulation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation)) for electronic transactions within Europe.
Qualified electronic signatures are the digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.
QES predominantly verifies individual account holders and requires a manual, asynchronous identity review by an expert before starting the signature.

### PVID {#pvid}

> French: *Prestataires de vÃ©rification d'identitÃ© Ã  distance*<br />
> English: *Remote Identity Verification Service Providers*

PVID verifies a user's identity by capturing and verifying identity documents, then performing facial recognition.

Any individual opening an account with a French IBAN can use PVID to complete identification if you configure it that way.

### Recommendations {#processes-recommendations}

Accepted identification processes vary by country based on local regulations.
For each [account country](../../accounts/index.mdx#account-country) and type of account, Swan recommends a process and, if possible, offers other acceptable processes.

Refer to the following table for accepted and recommended identification levels for individual and company accounts.
The first process listed is in bold with a checkmark (âœ“), indicating it's the process Swan recommends.

| Account country | Individual accounts | Company accounts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France | **âœ“ PVID**<br />Expert + [first transfer](#qes-first-transfer)<br />QES | **âœ“ Expert**<br />QES<br />PVID |
| ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany | **âœ“ QES** + [first transfer](#qes-first-transfer) | **âœ“ Expert**<br />QES |
| ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Netherlands | **âœ“ Expert**<br />QES<br />PVID | **âœ“ Expert**<br />QES<br />PVID |
| ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain | **âœ“ Expert**<br />QES<br />PVID | **âœ“ Expert**<br />QES<br />PVID |

:::info Self-employed account holders
For users who are **self-employed** account holders, recommendations depend on their status.

- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **France unregistered self-employed**: PVID, or Expert + a first transfer
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **France registered self-employed**: Expert
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Germany self-employed**: QES + a first transfer

## Tracking identifications {#tracking}

You can access all identifications performed by users who are onboarding into your project with the `user` query, which allows you to:

- Follow identifications in **real time**.
- Access a detailed **list of reasons** identifications aren't accepted. The list can help you guide users so they can successfully verify their identity.

Refer to the guides in this section for full sample queries and payloads of the `user` query.

You can also use the Event Simulator (**Dashboard** > **Developers** > **Event Simulator** > **Sandbox users**) to test various combinations of statuses, identification processes, and rejection reason codes.

## Identity documents {#levels-documents}

Swan offers an identity document sharing feature, providing access to identity verification **document metadata** as well as the documents themselves.
Contact your dedicated account manager to learn more.
