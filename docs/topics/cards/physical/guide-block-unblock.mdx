# Block & unblock physical cards

:::caution Blocked for incorrect PIN attempts
If a card was blocked without request, it might be because the card holder made too many [incorrect attempts to enter their PIN](./index.mdx#pin-incorrect-attempts).

In this case, you need to wait 24 hours before you can unlock the card, and the card holder must enter the PIN at an ATM.
:::

## Temporarily block a physical card {#block}

You can temporarily suspend a physical card with the `suspendPhysicalCardmutation`.

## Unblock a physical card {#unblock}

Unblock a physical card by calling the `resumePhysicalCard` mutation which returns a consent.
When you do this, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token using the name of the card's account member.
Then a `consentUrl` is returned which invites the user to start the Strong Customer Authentication with Swan.

- If you chose to block the card, the card can be used immediately after you unblock it.
- If the card was blocked because the PIN was entered incorrectly three times, the card holder must enter their PIN at an ATM before the card can be used again.
