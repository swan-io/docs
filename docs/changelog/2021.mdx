## October - December 2021 {#2021-q4}

### 16 December

<h4>New features</h4>

🤳 Users can now [consent using biometry](../topics/users/consent/index.mdx#sca-user). To try it out for yourself, just clear your browser data. During your next consent, we'll ask you to register your FaceId, TouchId, or Fingerprint. Passcode will only be requested if a user has changed their mobile device.

📲 Some of you wish to send notifications via your own app, to offer a great UX just like the best neobanks. This is now possible. Just [define your preferred consent notification channel](../topics/users/consent/index.mdx#notifications), SMS or App, by using the new `updateUserConsentSettings` mutation.

✅ Thanks to the new `updateOnboarding` and `finalizeOnboarding` mutations you are not obligated to use our #nocode interfaces. You can [onboard customers directly from your product](../topics/onboarding/index.mdx), if you prefer.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

🔍 We added new account filters : `canManageAccountMembership`, `canManageBeneficiaries`, `canInitiatePayments` and new `accountMemberships` filters: `status`, `canInitiatePayments`, `canManageAccountMembership`, `canManageBeneficiaries`.

📜 The list of transactions associated to a received direct debit mandate can now be retrieved using the API.

🏃 The dashboard lets you sort webhook event logs using 2 new filters: `eventId` and `resourceId`. View each webhook's KPIs for the last 7 days: hits, counter, and error rate. We also added 2 new events: `Onboarding.created` and `Onboarding.updated`.

🚮 Transactions where `paymentProduct` is `SEPACreditTransfer` and status is `Upcoming` can now be canceled using the `cancelTransaction` mutation.

<h4>Bug fixes</h4>

💳 When requesting physical cards, the Company Name and the Name/Last Name are now truncated to 38 characters. This is a mail delivery requirement.

🌍 The card language (used for 3DS, ATM screens and delivery envelopes) is dynamically assigned. Available languages: DE, FR, IT, NL, EN, ES. When a language is not available, the default language is EN.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

🔢 [Pagination](../developers/using-api/pagination.mdx) on the `accountHolders`, `accountMemberships`, and `accounts` queries has been fixed. It might break if you implement the filter on the front-end. These queries now only return the requested number of items, rather than all items at once.

### 07 December

<h4>New features</h4>

🍏 Swan's Apple Pay offer is expanded across 19 EU countries: 🇦🇹 Austria, 🇧🇪 Belgium, 🇨🇾 Cyprus, 🇪🇪 Estonia, 🇫🇮 Finland, 🇫🇷 France, 🇩🇪 Germany, 🇬🇷 Greece, 🇮🇪 Ireland, 🇮🇹 Italy, 🇱🇻 Latvia, 🇱🇹 Lithuania, 🇱🇺 Luxembourg, 🇲🇹 Malta, 🇳🇱 Netherlands, 🇵🇹 Portugal, 🇸🇰 Slovakia, 🇸🇮 Slovenia, and 🇪🇸 Spain.

### 18 November

<h4>New features</h4>

👥 [Add up to 200 account memberships](../topics/accounts/memberships/guide-add-multiple.mdx) using just one consent with the `addAccountMemberships` mutation.

💳 [Add up to 200 cards](../topics/cards/virtual/guide-add.mdx#add-multiple), and print their physical version using just one consent with the `addCards` mutation. Since card creation is executed asynchronously, we created a new card status: `Processing`. We deprecated the `status` filter on the `cards` query and created `statuses` so you can filter when there are multiple ones.

✅ The new [`ibanValidation` query](../topics/accounts/ibans/guide-validate.mdx) helps you verify the format of an external IBAN, get all available bank info (name, BIC code, etc.) and account data available for this IBAN, as well as the reachability of this IBAN across all SEPA schemes.

📃 [Sepa Direct Debit Core Mandates](../topics/payments/direct-debit/index.mdx#mandates) are now visible in the API under the account.`receivedDirectDebitMandates` query and can be suspended with the  `suspendReceivedDirectDebitMandate` mutation or resumed with the  `resumeReceivedDirectDebitMandate` mutation.

🤳🏾 During SCA, avoid asking your customer to enter their phone number, first name, last name, and birth date on the Swan user form. Query parameters during the [oauth 2 process](../developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user.mdx#code-receive) let you do this.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

🪝 Some webhook events used to be fired a few milliseconds too early, and now are fired right on time.

🔄 Just in case a webhook event is incorrectly integrated on your side, we've added a retry button to the dashboard.

📬 Simulate physical card delivery from the dashboard.

🇪🇺 Our compliance team did a lot of work to allow you to onboard individuals and now companies [across all of Europe](../partnership/overview/country-coverage.mdx).
