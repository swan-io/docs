  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>
  <div>
ü™™ On **February 29th**, we're removing the following deprecated fields: `accountMemberships.recommendedIdentificationLevel`, `OnboardingInfo.legalRepresentativeRecommendedIdentificationLevel`, and `Onboarding.legalRepresentativeRecommendedIdentificationLevel`.
This deprecation is linked to the [`Auto` identification level announcement](changelog/28-november-2024/).

‚ö†Ô∏è Effective from **March 10th**, consent notification API requests to your endpoint time out after 2 seconds instead of 3, in order to comply with 3-D Secure (3DS) requirements.

üîó On **April 1st**, we're removing the [deprecated field `Onboarding.redirectUrl`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding/#onboardingredirecturlstring---) from all onboarding mutations.
Instead, use the `OAuthRedirectParameters.redirectUrl` field, also in the [onboarding object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding#onboardingoauthredirectparametersoauthredirectparameters-).
