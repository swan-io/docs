## Improvements

The Testing APIs `simulateMerchantProfileRequestOutcome` and `simulateMerchantPaymentMethodRequestOutcome` now support the new `WaitingForInformation` status and return a list of `verificationRequirements`.

A new optional field `expectedMerchantProfileAdditionalInformation` is now available at the `projectInfo` level. 
This field is only available upon prior agreement with Swan and allows you to customize information collected for merchant profiles in specific use cases. 
The information can then be provided using the `additionalInformation` field in merchant profiles and in the `requestMerchantProfile` and `requestMerchantProfileUpdate` mutations.

The `expectedMonthlyPaymentVolume`, `invoiceExample`, `merchantWebsite`, `socialNetwork`, `supportWebsite`, and `termsAndConditions` fields have been deprecated. We've introduced the `expectedMonthlyMerchantProcessingVolume`, `merchantWebsiteUrl`, `socialNetworkUrl`, `supportWebsiteUrl`, and `termsAndConditionsUrl` fields.

We've deprecated and replaced `rejectReasons` with `rejectionReasons` for rejected merchant profiles and merchant payment methods.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes


ðŸ’³ On **October 16th**, the `CardUrl` field will be removed. This field is being deprecated. Use `cardMaskedNumber`, `expiryDate`, and `cardDesignUrl` instead.

ðŸ›’ On **October 16th**, the following merchant onboarding and payment methods breaking changes will take effect:

- A new `WaitingForInformation` status and `verificationRequirements` list will be available for merchant profiles on Merchant Payment Methods to communicate missing information. These requirements must be provided at the merchant profile level using the `requestMerchantProfile` and `requestMerchantProfileUpdate` mutations. 
- A new `supportingDocumentCollections` field will also be available at the merchant profile level for providing required documents.
- The fields `invoiceExample`, `expectedMonthlyPaymentVolume`, `merchantWebsite`, `socialNetwork`, `supportWebsite`, `termsAndConditions` will be **removed** from the API.
- `rejectReasons` will be removed for Card Payment Methods.
- `rejectionReasons` for `Rejected` merchant profiles and Merchant Payment Methods will become mandatory in the Testing APIs `simulateMerchantProfileRequestOutcome` and `simulateMerchantPaymentMethodRequestOutcome`.
- Dynamic rolling reserve changes and maximum payment amount limits will be introduced at the merchant payment method level to mitigate risk. Subscribe to the `MerchantPaymentMethod.Created` and `MerchantPaymentMethod.Updated` webhooks for these updates.

ðŸ’¸ Effective **October 19th**, we're introducing the following updates to the `initiateCreditTransfers` endpoint to improve its usability and clarity:

- The `save` parameter will now default to `false`.
- The `mode` parameter is now a **required** field. The default value is set to `Regular`.
- The `isMyOwnIban` and `beneficiaryId` input fields have been **removed**.
- The API will now return a `ValidationRejection` error instead of `ForbiddenRejection` when an input contains **invalid** data.

## Update

ðŸ§­ Starting **October 21st**, card-issuing spending limits will be aggregated at the hour level. 
For spending-limit computation, each payment will be timestamped at the first second of the first minute of the hour, and each hour will reset the rolling period.
This change applies to cards with `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly` spending limit periods.
