# Request in-person card payment method

Request the in-person card payment method so your merchants can accept card payments using their smartphone terminal.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- A **merchant profile** with the status **Enabled**. If you don't have one yet, [request a merchant profile](../../../topics/merchants/profiles/guide-request.mdx) first.
- A project access token, or, if you're an account member, a user access token with **Can manage members** user rights.

## Request the payment method {#request}

Call the `requestMerchantPaymentMethods` mutation.

{/* TODO: Verify exact PaymentMethodInput shape for InPersonCard with engineering. The paymentMethods input likely uses InPersonCard as the method type, but the exact field structure needs confirmation. */}

```graphql
mutation RequestInPersonCardMethod {
  requestMerchantPaymentMethods(
    input: {
      merchantProfileId: "$YOUR_MERCHANT_PROFILE_ID"
      paymentMethods: [
        {
          type: InPersonCard
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    ... on RequestMerchantPaymentMethodsSuccessPayload {
      __typename
      merchantPaymentMethods {
        id
        methodName
        statusInfo {
          status
        }
        version
      }
    }
    ... on ForbiddenRejection {
      __typename
      message
    }
    ... on MerchantProfileNotReadyRejection {
      __typename
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Payment method review {#review}

The payment method is created with the status `PendingReview` and version number `1`.

Swan reviews all new merchant payment methods. Swan might contact you for additional information before accepting or rejecting the payment method.

After the review, the status is updated to either `Enabled` or `Rejected`.

| Status | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `PendingReview` | Payment method submitted and waiting for Swan's review. |
| `Enabled` | Payment method approved. The merchant can accept in-person card payments. |
| `Suspended` | Swan suspended the payment method due to detected risk. |
| `Disabled` | Payment method deactivated. |
| `Rejected` | Payment method rejected. The decision is final. The merchant must submit a new request. |
