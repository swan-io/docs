# Verification of Payee


:::warning
**Starting October 9, 2025**, Verification of Payee (VoP) becomes mandatory across Europe per the Instant Payments Regulation (IPR).
:::

Verify beneficiary details against their IBAN before sending SEPA Credit Transfers to reduce fraud and misdirected payments.

:::tip Automatic integration
Swan automatically integrates VoP into existing credit transfer flows. 
Your current [`initiateCreditTransfers`](./guide-initiate-ct#guide-sepa) calls will include VoP verification with no required changes.
:::

## Benefits {#benefits}

VoP provides immediate value to your users and business:

- **Fraud Prevention**: Verify recipient details before payment execution
- **User Trust**: Clear feedback builds confidence in payment accuracy  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet IPR requirements automatically starting October 9, 2025
- **Reduced Disputes**: Fewer misdirected payments and customer support issues

## How VoP works {#how-it-works}

When you call [`initiateCreditTransfers`](./guide-initiate-ct#guide-sepa), Swan verifies the beneficiary name against the IBAN at the receiving bank before presenting the consent screen.

VoP works for SEPA Credit Transfers (regular and instant) and internal transfers between Swan accounts.

### VoP results in Consent {#results}

Swan displays VoP results in the consent screen with one of four outcomes:

| Result | Description | User Experience | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Match** ✅ | Exact name match | ✅ Proceed normally | Continue to consent |
| **Close Match** ⚠️ | Slight discrepancy | ⚠️ Show suggested name | User can proceed or correct |
| **No Match** ❌ | Name doesn't match | ⚠️ Warning displayed | User can proceed with warning |
| **Verification Not Possible** ⚠️ | Technical failure | ⚠️ Service unavailable | User can proceed or retry |

When VoP shows Close Match, No Match, or Verification Not Possible, users see a warning but can still authorize the payment.

## Implementation strategy {#strategy}

### Essential implementation (early release)
1. Optionally **call [`verifySepaBeneficiary`](./guide-verify-beneficiary#mutation-individual)** when users add beneficiaries
2. **Include tokens** in [`initiateCreditTransfers`](./guide-initiate-ct#guide-sepa)) when available  
3. **Handle all 4 result types** in your UI
4. **Test with sandbox IBANs** before going live

### Enhanced features coming October 9
- [Pre-verification](./guide-verify-beneficiary) for bulk payments
- Standing order verification
- Advanced error recovery patterns

## Regulatory timeline {#timeline}

- **July 2025**: Swan APIs available in Sandbox
- **August 2025**: Partner integration testing
- **October 9, 2025**: VoP becomes mandatory (automatic activation)

Swan handles all regulatory compliance automatically. No action required for basic functionality.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

### Immediate compliance (no action needed)
Swan handles VoP automatically starting October 9, 2025. Your existing transfers will include verification.

### Enhanced implementation (recommended)
1. **Test VoP scenarios** in [Sandbox environment](./sandbox.mdx)
2. **Add [pre-verification](./guide-verify-beneficiary)** to your beneficiary workflows
3. **Display VoP results** before payment submission

## API overview {#api-overview}

### Core APIs for MVP

**[Pre-verification](./guide-verify-beneficiary)** (recommended):
```graphql
verifySepaBeneficiary(
  input: VerifySepaBeneficiaryInput!
): VerifySepaBeneficiaryPayload!
```

**Enhanced [credit transfers](./guide-initiate-ct#guide-sepa)**:
```graphql
initiateCreditTransfers(
  input: InitiateCreditTransfersInput!
): InitiateCreditTransfersPayload!
```

## Implementation effort {#effort}

| Integration Level | Development Time | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Basic** | 0 hours | Automatic VoP in consent (no changes needed) |
| **Recommended** | 2-5 days | Pre-verification, result display, error handling |
