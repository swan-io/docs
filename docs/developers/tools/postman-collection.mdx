# Postman collection

Postman is a platform for API development and testing.
Use Swan's Postman collection with OAuth 2.0 authentication as a sample implementation to help with your integration.

:::tip Prerequisites
You have a [Postman account](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) and you're logged in.
You can either use the [Postman app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or the web version.
:::

:::info Swan Banking Frontend
Along with this Postman collection, you can use the open source [Swan Banking Frontend](https://swan-io.github.io/swan-partner-frontend/getting-started).

Modify the open source code to provide a web banking app that matches your company's style and your user onboarding flows.
The open source project contains the code Swan uses for their banking interface.

## Step 3: Get Dashboard information

After you download the collection, configure Postman to communicate with your Swan Dashboard.

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Developers** > **API**.
1. Notice the location of your **Client ID** in the OAuth 2.0 Credentials block.
1. Notice the location of your **Client secret** in the OAuth 2.0 Credentials block. If needed, generate a new secret.
1. Locate your saved redirect **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) in the Redirect URIs block.

:::info Consent
For you to generate a user access token for one of your users, the user must consent.

After clicking **Get New Access Token**, Swan sends a text message to the mobile number saved for this user.
The user needs to use their phone to consent to your user access token before you can continue.
