## Swan protects you and your users {#protect}

Your protection is Swan's priority.
Consider the following ways Swan strives to keep you and your users safe.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Area</th>
    <th>Protection</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">‚àó **Contact with your users**</td>
    <td>**Swan never calls your users unexpectedly**. If a user receives an unplanned phone call from Swan, strongly encourage them to hang up, then inform you and Swan immediately.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To keep communication with you and your users secure, Swan prefers that both you and your users **open tickets instead of emailing Support**. The [partner](https://partner-support.swan.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new) and [end-user](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18444696903837) support forms initiate a secure way to communicate about sensitive topics.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Swan might ask your user to **verify their name** or **phone number** to confirm their identity. Any other requests for sensitive or account information occur through secure tickets and exclusively for valid reasons, such as an enhanced transaction review.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">**Payments**</td>
    <td>Swan offers [single-use virtual cards (SUVs)](../../../topics/cards/virtual/index.mdx#suv). Consider **prioritizing issuing SUVs** as it's more difficult to use them fraudulently.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You and your users can **save [trusted beneficiaries](../../../topics/payments/credit-transfers/index.mdx#beneficiaries)**. Only eligible account members can send credit transfers to unsaved beneficiaries.</td>
  </tr>
  <td>When making online payments, you and your users must **complete [3-D Secure (3DS)](../../../topics/payments/cards/index.mdx#3ds)**, an extra security layer when paying online. Please note that Mastercard might bypass 3DS if they decide a payment is low risk.</td>
    <tr>
    <td rowspan="4">**Authentication** and **Consent**</td>
    <td>To access Swan platforms, you and your users must [**log in**](../../../topics/users/index.mdx#login). If there's no activity for a set time period, you're [**automatically logged out**](../../../developers/index.mdx#ttl) to ensure the security of your account.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Swan uses a mix of biometrics, passcodes, and one-time passwords to **secure access** to Swan platforms.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You and your users must **[consent](../../../topics/users/consent/index.mdx#sensitive) to all sensitive operations**.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One time **every 24 hours**, your users are required to **acknowledge a fraud warning** before consenting to a transfer.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

‚àó *You, your users, and Swan each have a direct relationship due to the [three-party partnership model](../../index.mdx#model).
As a result, Swan contacts your users directly, when necessary, respecting strict privacy guidelines.*

### Prevent {#prevent}

Preventing fraud is a critical responsibility shared by you, your users, and Swan.
Follow these tips strengthen your product integration and help your users avoid falling victim to fraud.

#### üß† Know what fraud looks like. {#educate}

Fraud often looks close to the real thing, but not quite.
Any time a communication feels suspicious, evaluate it closely, applying the actions described in this section.

Learn about different types of fraud and how they're attempted.
Review the page covering [common types of fraud](./types.mdx), and stay informed about new ways fraudulent individuals are trying to trick people.

#### ‚è≥ Don't respond urgently. {#urgency}

Fraudulent individuals try to pressure you and your users into believing that their request is urgent and must happen immediately.
Don't fall for it.
Instead, follow established processes. Don't let fraudulent individuals convince you to bypass processes due to urgency.

#### üí¨ Use a secondary communication channel. {#comm-channel}

If you're concerned about a request, it's never a bad idea to confirm with the person or organization who sent the request in another way.
Don't hesitate to contact them through another communication channel.

If they called you, email them.
If they emailed you, call or text them.
You could also contact them on a social media platform you know they use and control.

#### üîé Double-check. {#double-check}

If a request feels suspicious, it never hurts to double-check.
Check for typos or errors in names, websites, email addresses, and messages.
If you receive a phone call, consider whether it sounds authentic.

When requests include a link, hover over the link and look in the bottom corner of your browser to confirm the link looks legitimate.
You could also open a new tab or window and search for the website on your own instead of opening the link provided.

#### üîê Protect account information. {#protect-info}

You and your users have a lot of control around protecting your account information.
Use unique passwords and passcodes every time.
Store them in a secure password manager.

Consider making multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-factor authentication (2FA) mandatory for your product, and activate it for personal use for any app you can.
Help your users understand that activating MFA or 2FA is like adding a second lock to a door, for which the key is a one-time password texted to you or a code from a secure app.
While MFA and 2FA add an extra step to logging in, they increase online safety significantly.

Pairing strong password hygiene with MFA or 2FA keeps your information much safer.

Never share login information using insecure channels, like text message or email.
If you need to share login information with someone you trust, use your password manager's built-in sharing feature.

#### ‚òëÔ∏è Stay up-to-date {#update}

Keep the software on your computers, phones, and other devices up to date.
Software providers regularly improve built-in safety measures, so take the time to install updates.

Review Swan's [Changelog](/changelog/) regularly and update your integration accordingly so your product remains secure.

:::note
Putting these tips into practice can help you and your users to prevent fraud as online fraudulent activity becomes increasingly prevalent.
:::

### React {#react}

If you or your users suspect fraud, **please react immediately**.
Remember, Swan never contacts you or your users to transfer money outside of established Support channels.
As a Swan Partner, you also shouldn't contact your users to transfer money.

:::caution Communication channels
If a request feels urgent, your users should contact the requester using a second, previously known communication channel.
For example, if your user **receives an email request**, they should **call the requester** using a phone number they already have‚Äînot a phone number provided in the original email.
:::

Swan invites you and your users to **be SAFE, not sorry** (borrowing from the [Yale University Information Security Office](https://cybersecurity.yale.edu/)).
Encourage the following behavior from your users, and practice it yourselves.

| Action | Explanation |
| :---: | --- |
| **`S`**<br />**See something suspicious?** | Pay attention to how you feel about a request, and encourage your users to pay attention, too.<br /><br /><ul><li>Do you feel **fearful** or **scared**?</li><li>Is the requester pressuring you to act **urgently** or **quickly**?</li><li>Does the request feel **questionable** or **suspicious**?</li></ul>If the answer to any of these questions is yes, **take a step back** before responding. **Trust how you feel**. |
| **`A`**<br />**Act quickly** | [Report](#report) the incident to Swan right away. Don't wait, don't be embarrassed, and don't let someone talk you out of your gut feeling about the incident.<br /><br />However, don't respond quickly to the request. Wait to transfer funds or provide information until it's confirmed to be a legitimate request. |
| **`F`**<br />**Follow instructions** | Provide Swan with all requested information as quickly as possible. Stay actively responsive as Swan follows up on the incident. |
| **`E`**<br />**Exercise discretion** | Be careful until you know the account is secure. [Reset passcodes](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/20531243310749), limit [account membership permissions](../../../topics/accounts/memberships/index.mdx#permissions), and anything else you feel might protect you until the incident is resolved. |
