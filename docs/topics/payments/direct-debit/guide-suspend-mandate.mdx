# Suspend a payment mandate

Suspend SEPA Direct Debit received payment mandates with the API.

[From old doc](https://docs.swan.io/concept/payment/direct-debit#suspension-of-a-received-sepa-direct-debit-mandate):

- A received SEPA direct debit mandate can be suspended using the suspendReceivedDirectDebitMandate mutation, by any accountMembership with the CanInitiatePayments rights on the account to which the received SEPA direct debit mandate is associated.
- Once the mutation is successfully executed, the received SEPA direct debit mandate is switched to Suspended status.
- At the reception date and debit date of a SEPA direct debit instruction, Swan verifies among other things the status of the underlying received SEPA direct debit mandate.
- The transaction is automatically rejected if the latter has Suspended status.
