# Supporting document collection

import SupportingDocumentCollectionDefinition from '../../definitions/_onboarding-supporting-documents.mdx';

> <SupportingDocumentCollectionDefinition />

Swan is sometimes required to collect documents to **verify account holder details**.
Each **document** is uploaded individually into a **collection**.
After all required documents are uploaded, Swan **reviews the collection**.

## Required documents {#required-documents}

The documents required varies significantly depending on where your users are located, whether they're individuals or companies, and more.
The best way to understand what is required from your user is to always [get a list of required documents](./guide-get-list.mdx) when you create the onboarding link.

You can review accepted document formats in the [document center](../../../partnership/document-center/index.mdx).

## Options for collecting documents {#collect-documents}

There are two primary options to collect required supporting documents:

1. Use the API.
    1. No emails are exchanged.
    1. You'll know every time a document is needed with webhook notifications.
    1. You communicate with your end users to gather the required documents.
    1. Choose the API or the Dashboard for most actions, including uploading documents.
1. Swan communicates directly with you or your end users.
    1. You or your end user receives an email.
    1. You or your end user uploads the document through Web Banking.
    1. You'll be able to see the document after the upload.
    1. There is no trace of your documents in the API if you use the email option.

Swan recommends **using the API** to manage documents and collections.

## Collection statuses {#collection-statuses}

Each **collection** runs through the following statuses.
This process starts after an onboarding is created.

```

| Collection status | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `Waiting for document` | Onboarding is created and ready for documents, or documents were submitted but Swan is requesting additional documents<br/><br/>**Next step**: moves to `Pending review` after onboarding is finalized |
| `Pending review` | Onboarding is finalized and a document review is needed<br/><br/>**Next step**: Can move to `Approved`, `Rejected`, or `Canceled` depending on partner actions and Swan decisions (or, if documents are insufficient → `Waiting for document`) |
| `Approved` | Swan approved the supporting document collection |
| `Rejected` | Swan rejected the supporting document collection |
| `Canceled` | Swan canceled the supporting document collection (this could also be at the partner's request) |

## Document statuses {#document-statuses}

Supporting document collections are empty when created.
Swan can upload some documents, and you can add documents to these collections as requested.
For each required document, you'll create a document within the collection.

Each **document** added to a collection runs through the following statuses.

```mermaid
%%{ init: { 'flowchart': { 'curve': 'linear' } } }%%

    DO((Document<br/>created)) -.-> W[WaitingForUpload]
    W --> NU[NotUploaded]
    W -.-> U[Uploaded]
    U --> V[Validated]
    U --> RF[Refused]
    U --> D[Deleted]
    subgraph F[Final status]

        RF
        D
        NU
    end
    style DO fill:#D4D3D5,stroke:#514F59
    style F fill:#fffdf4,stroke:#cca922
```

| Document status | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `Waiting for upload` | URL to upload the document has been generated<br/><br/>**Next step**:<br/><ul><li>If the document is uploaded → `Uploaded`</li><li>If the collection switches to a final status before the document is uploaded → `Not uploaded`</li></ul> |
| `Uploaded` | Document is uploaded; if a review is completed on the uploaded document, the status moves to `Validated`, `Refused`, or `Deleted` depending on Partner actions and Swan decisions |
| `Validated` | Swan approved the document |
| `Refused` | Swan refused the document |
| `Deleted` | Swan or the partner deleted the document |
| `Not uploaded` | URL was generated but collection was closed before a document was uploaded |

## Document purposes and types {#document-purposes-types}

For all supporting documents, there is a high-level **purpose** and a more specific **type** (`supportingDocumentPurpose` and `supportingDocumentType`).
Both purpose and type can be exposed in the onboarding success payload.

**Common purposes** (not exhaustive):

* `CompanyRegistration`
* `SignedStatus`
* `ProofOfAddress`
* `ProofOfIncome`
* `Other`

## Webhooks {#webhooks}

There are two webhooks associated with supporting documents:

- `SupportingDocumentCollection.Created`
- `SupportingDocumentCollection.Updated`
