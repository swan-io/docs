## Overview {#overview}

You're aware of events you request or that your user's request directly from you.
Consider the [basic API flow](../index.mdx#overview) for reference.
However, **not all events are under your control**; some events are triggered by external parties.
When external events occur, resources are updated in Swan, but you aren't notified by default.

If you **subscribe to webhooks for these external events**, Swan initiates a request on your endpoint and you receive webhook notifications.
Requests to your endpoint **must be answered** with a 200 OK HTTP response.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant P as Partner (you)
participant S as Swan
participant E as External event
    E -->> S: Updates an API resource
    S ->> P: Sends request to your configured endpoints
    par        
        P ->> S: Returns 200 OK HTTP
        P ->> S: Calls query for resource
    end
    S ->> P: Returns resource
```

:::tip
For guidance on optimizing your webhook setup, refer to [best practices for webhook consumption](#best-practices).
:::

### Response time {#overview-response}

Webhooks operate with a near-real-time efficiency, typically delivering responses **within seconds** of the event.

It's worth clarifying that webhooks don't actively *respond* but autonomously send information to your system, potentially introducing delays of up to 10 minutes after the actual action occurs.

### Time to reply {#overview-reply}

Your endpoint must respond with a `200 OK` HTTP status code within **10 seconds**. 
To avoid timeouts, respond immediately and handle the event asynchronously. 
A timeout is considered a delivery failure and is [automatically retried](/developers/using-api/webhooks/#overview-retry).

### Automatic retry {#overview-retry}

If Swan encounters an error during a webhook request, the request is retried every **30 seconds** and up to **7 times**.

If all retries fail, you can retry it manually by selecting **Retry** from your **Dashboard** > **Developers** > **Webhooks**.
You can also trigger the webhook manually at any time.

### Subscription limits {#subscription-limits}

In order to avoid overconsumption caused by too many subscriptions to the same webhook event, there's a limit on how many subscriptions you can enable per event.
Consider following [best practices for webhook consumption](#best-practices) to optimize your subscription strategy.

The following limits apply:

- **Sandbox**: 10 subscriptions per event
- **Live**: 5 subscriptions per event

:::warning Legacy subscriptions
All webhook subscriptions enabled before these limits were established remain intact.
However, you won't be able to add additional subscriptions for the same event.

For example, if you had 12 subscriptions to a Sandbox event:

- All 12 subscriptions remain active.
- To add a new subscription to that event, delete 3 existing subscriptions first.
:::

### Security {#overview-security}

Webhooks notify your application that an event has occurred, but they don't contain sensitive information. 
If an event involves sensitive information, use the Swan API or Dashboard, both of which require authentication, to retrieve the full details.

To help verify that webhook requests actually come from Swan and not someone who just knows your endpoint URL, you can use **webhook secrets**. Each request includes a shared secret in the `x-swan-secret` header. This secret acts like a password, known only to you and Swan.

We strongly recommend checking the HTTP header on every webhook request. 
If you've set a webhook secret and it's missing or incorrect, reject the request to prevent unauthorized or fake webhook attempts.

:::note Swan's webhook IP addresses
If you have security restrictions in your infrastructure, you might need to add the following IPs to your allowlist for both Sandbox and Live environments.

- 52.210.172.90
- 52.51.125.72
- 54.194.47.212

## Best practices for webhook consumption {#best-practices}

Effective webhook management ensures critical events are processed promptly and improves your integration's reliability.

### Subscribe only to essential events {#best-practices-subscription}

Determine exactly which events your integration needs rather than subscribing to all available events.

**Challenges of subscribing to all events:**

- **Processing bottlenecks**: You risk delaying critical events behind a queue of high-volume, low-priority events.
- **Event volume spikes**: Frequent events like `Transaction.Booked` can bury rarer, high-value events like `Account.Created`.
- **Blind spots during downtime**: When a single endpoint receives all events, any downtime creates a significant backlog across all event types.

**How to choose your events:**

- **Immediate impact**: Prioritize events affecting user-facing operations (e.g., `Consent.Granted`, `AccountMembership.Suspended`).
- **Business criticality**: Include events that trigger essential workflows or compliance requirements.
- **Batch processing**: Consider whether high-volume events like `Transaction.Booked` can be processed asynchronously.

You can create, modify, or remove subscriptions at any time. Start with essential events and expand as needed.

### Use separate endpoints by priority {#best-practices-endpoints}

Create separate webhook subscriptions with dedicated endpoints for different priority levels.
This ensures critical events are processed immediately, regardless of overall event volume.

**Challenges of using a single endpoint:**

- **Cascading delays**: High-volume routine events block time-sensitive critical events.
- **Difficult troubleshooting**: Issues affect all event types simultaneously, making it harder to find the source of the problem.
- **Scaling limitations**: Increasing capacity for critical events requires increasing it for all events.

**How to structure your endpoints:**

- **Isolate by priority**: Route critical events (consent, account status changes) to a dedicated high-priority endpoint.
- **Scale independently**: Allocate endpoint capacity based on specific event volume and priority.
- **Separate by function**: Use different endpoints for distinct workflows so an issue in one area doesn't block another.

#### Example: Multiple subscription setup {#best-practices-example}

Create separate subscriptions for different priority levels.

```graphql title="Critical events endpoint"
mutation AddCriticalEventsSubscription {
  addWebhookSubscription(
    input: {
      label: "Critical events"
      endpoint: "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhooks/critical"
      secret: "$YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_CRITICAL"
      eventTypes: [
        "Consent.Granted"
        "Consent.Refused"
        "AccountMembership.Suspended"
        "Account.Closing"
      ]
      status: Enabled
    }
  ) {
    ... on WebhookSubscriptionSuccessPayload {
      __typename
      webhookSubscription {
        id
        label
        endpoint
        eventTypes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Payment events endpoint"
mutation AddPaymentEventsSubscription {
  addWebhookSubscription(
    input: {
      label: "Payment events"
      endpoint: "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhooks/payments"
      secret: "$YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_PAYMENTS"
      eventTypes: [
        "Transaction.Booked"
        "Transaction.Pending"
        "Transaction.Rejected"
        "MerchantPayment.Captured"
      ]
      status: Enabled
    }
  ) {
    ... on WebhookSubscriptionSuccessPayload {
      __typename
      webhookSubscription {
        id
        label
        endpoint
        eventTypes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Administrative events endpoint"
mutation AddAdminEventsSubscription {
  addWebhookSubscription(
    input: {
      label: "Administrative events"
      endpoint: "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhooks/admin"
      secret: "$YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_ADMIN"
      eventTypes: [
        "AccountInvoice.Generated"
        "AccountStatement.Generated"
        "SupportingDocumentCollection.Updated"
      ]
      status: Enabled
    }
  ) {
    ... on WebhookSubscriptionSuccessPayload {
      __typename
      webhookSubscription {
        id
        label
        endpoint
        eventTypes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Event handling {#event-handling}

Handling webhooks is important to make sure your integration's business logic works as expected.

### Delivery method {#event-handling-delivery}

Swan webhooks are designed following the `at-least once` delivery method.
Taking transactions as an example, the `at-least once` delivery means that for the same `eventId`, you might receive more than one notification.

Swan chose `at-least once` delivery deliberately over the `at-most once` delivery; it's better you receive the information multiple times instead of not at all, which can occur with `at-most once` in case of technical error.

### Notification content {#event-handling-info}

Webhook notifications contain the following information in a `POST` request:

```
{
  "eventType": "Transaction.Booked",
  "eventId": "$YOUR_EVENT_ID",
  "eventDate": "2021-08-18T09:35:46.673Z",
  "projectId": "$YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  "resourceId": "$YOUR_RESOURCE_ID"
}
```

Note that `eventType` is the action performed on which resource type, `eventId` is a unique ID for this event, and  `resourceId` is a unique ID for the resource.

:::caution Limited information
For security reasons, webhook notifications **include limited information**.
You can always **query the API** for more information about these events.
:::

### Idempotent process {#event-handling-idempotent}

Due to `at-least once` delivery, a webhook endpoint might receive the same event notification multiple times.
Therefore, Swan strongly suggests **making your event processing idempotent**, essentially making sure your response to webhook notifications can be repeated multiple times without producing different outcomes.

For example, you might log the events you've processed, and then not process events that are already logged.

### Manage webhooks with the API {#event-handling-api}

You can manage your webhooks with the API.

1. **Add** a new webhook subscription: [`addWebhookSubscription`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/add-webhook-subscription/).
1. **Update** a webhook subscription: [`updateWebhookSubscription`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/update-webhook-subscription/).
1. **Remove** a webhook subscription: [`removeWebhookSubscription`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/remove-webhook-subscription/).
1. **Trigger a retry** of a failed webhook: [`replayWebhookEvent`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/replay-webhook-event/).
1. Subscriptions:
    1. Get a **single subscription**: [`webhookSubscription`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/webhook-subscription/).
    1. Get a **list of all subscriptions**: [`webhookSubscriptions`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/webhook-subscriptions/).
1. Event logs:
    1. Get **one event log**: [`webhookEventLog`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/webhook-event-log/).
    1. Get a **log of all events**: [`webhookEventLogs`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/webhook-event-logs/).

### Event order {#event-handling-order}

Webhook notifications aren't always delivered in the order the events occur.
If you want to receive webhooks in a specific order, you'll need to implement logic on your end.

For example, consider the regular card payment flow, which is always **Authorization** to **Debit** to **Released**.
The flow generates the following webhook events:

- Authorization: `Transaction.Pending`
- Debit: `Transaction.Booked`
- Released: `Transaction.Released`

You'll receive the `Transaction.Pending` as soon as the authorization is created.

However, you can receive `Transaction.Booked` and `Transaction.Released` webhooks in any order, even though the flow is always Debit, then Released.

```mermaid
%%{ init: { 'flowchart': { 'curve': 'linear' } } }%%

    A(<i>Authorization</i><br/>Transaction.Pending) --> P((Possibilities))
    P --> B(<i>Debit</i><br/>Transaction.Booked) --> D(<i>Released</i><br/>Transaction.Released)
