## Improvements

🔗 Supporting documents for merchant profiles can now be provided via a Web Banking link. Retrieve the upload form URL from [`supportingDocumentCollectionUrl`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-collection/#supportingdocumentcollectionsupportingdocumentcollectionurlstring--) in the associated [`SupportingDocumentCollection`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-collection/) object. Share this URL with your users so they can upload documents directly in Web Banking.

📩 Email notifications for account opening and member invitations are now white-labelled, allowing seamless integration with your product's brand. This applies to:

- Your account terms and conditions.
- First transfer.
- Request supporting documents (including reminders).
- Your account is opened.
- Join your banking space.

Some notifications can be configured with your Account Manager. Your project's current configuration has already been applied to avoid disruptions.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🛡️ Starting **December 18**, we're introducing stricter input validation for several mutations to improve security and error handling. The following fields now strictly enforce specific formats. Providing an incorrect value returns a `ValidationRejection` error:

- [`addVirtualIbanEntry`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/add-virtual-iban-entry/): The `accountId` field now accepts **only** a valid UUID.
- [`disableAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/disable-account-membership/) and [`resumeAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/resume-account-membership/): The `accountMembershipId` field now accepts **only** a valid UUID.
- [`resumeAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/resume-account-membership/): The `consentRedirectUrl` field now accepts **only** a valid URL format.
