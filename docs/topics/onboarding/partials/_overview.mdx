<div>
  Your main action is to <b>create {props.accountType} onboarding link</b>. The
  link leads your user to a <b>multi-step form</b> through which Swan collects
  essential information to open the account.
  <br />
  <br />
  When creating an onboarding link for your users, you can <b>
    pre-fill most of the information
  </b> for them. When your user goes through the form, they'll confirm that the information
  you entered is correct. Users can also fill in this information themselves.
