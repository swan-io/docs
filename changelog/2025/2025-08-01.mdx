## New features

📖 **Learn about the new [Verification of Payee regulation](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/verification-of-payee/)**, its impacts on your users, and how you can update your Swan integration to improve your payment experience.

🛡️ **Card insurance** is now available in beta with three coverage levels (Basic, Essential, Premium) to protect your users against identity theft, travel incidents, car rental issues, and legal disputes. Configure insurance at the card product level, and it will be automatically applied to all new cards. Learn more in our [card insurance documentation](/topics/cards/overview/card-insurance).

## Improvements

👥 Access more balance information on a booked transaction with `BookedTransactionStatusInfo.balanceAfter`. This object includes `amount`, which replaces the existing `bookedBalanceAfter.amount` (see upcoming breaking change) and `sequenceNumber`, a new account-level transaction counter for newly-generated transactions (historical transactions will display `null`).

🧭 **Customize column width on all pages of the dashboard**, for a better readability of data.

🪝 **Two new webhooks** are now available to update you on **rolling reserve changes**. `TransactionRollingReserve.Updated` is triggered when the release date is changed, and `TransactionRollingReserve.Released` will indicate that the reserved funds are now available.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

📄 Starting **August 28th**, we'll start using these new, already available enum variables: `USPersonStatusDeclaration` and `ProofOfBusinessActivity` for [SupportingDocumentPurpose](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-purpose/), and `W9`, `W8`, and `CertificateOfLossOfNationality` for [SupportingDocumentType](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/supporting-document-type/).

👥 Starting **December 31st**, the `bookedBalanceAfter` field will be removed from the transaction query. Please use the `balanceAfter.amount` on `BookedTransactionStatusInfo`.
