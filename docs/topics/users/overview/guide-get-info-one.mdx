# Get information about a single user

You can **call the API** to get information about a single user within your project.

Identification information is also available on your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Users**.

:::tip Prerequisites
You need a **project access token** to call the query.
You can also use a **user access token** without specifying the user ID, which returns information about the current user.
:::

## Guide {#guide}

1. Call the `user` query.
1. Add the user ID.
1. Add all information you'd like to review. The sample query returns the number of account memberships and cards, as well as the user's identity information and mobile number.
1. Add [pagination](../../../developers/using-api/pagination.mdx) if you want to narrow the results.
