## New feature

🇮🇹 **[Italian IBANs](/topics/accounts/ibans/#local) are now are live**! Generate onboarding links from your **Dashboard** > **Settings** > **Onboarding**.

## Improvements

🐓 **French [company onboardings](/topics/onboarding/company/) are now smoother**. 
In addition to previously auto-filling UBOs, the VAT number, and the address, we now automatically retrieve [representative information](/topics/onboarding/company/#retrieve-data-rep) and [company type](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/company-type/) when you add the company’s registration number. 
You no longer need to ask users if they’re the [legal representative](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/type-of-representation/); instead, compare their data to the retrieved information.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking change

👥 Starting on **April 10th**, the type of [`AccountMembershipsFilterInput.accountId`](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/account-memberships-filter-input/#accountmembershipsfilterinputaccountidstring-) will change from `String` to `ID`, making it consistent with the other filters.
