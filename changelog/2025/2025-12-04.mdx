## New features

🤖 Swan now provides [MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers](/developers/tools/mcp-servers) that give AI assistants direct access to Swan's GraphQL schema and documentation. Use them with tools like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or Cursor to generate accurate queries and get answers about the API.

## Improvements

🔗 Supporting documents for merchant profiles can now be provided via a Web Banking link. Retrieve the upload form URL from [`supportingDocumentCollectionUrl`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-collection/#supportingdocumentcollectionsupportingdocumentcollectionurlstring--) in the associated [`SupportingDocumentCollection`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-collection/) object. Share this URL with your users so they can upload documents directly in Web Banking.

📩 Several email notifications now support your project's branding (logo, accent colors):

- **Account onboarding**: Your account terms and conditions.
- **Account holder verification**: First transfer, Request supporting documents, Request supporting documents reminders, Your account is opened.
- **Account memberships**: Join your banking space.

Some notifications can be configured with your Account Manager. Your project's current configuration has already been applied to avoid disruptions.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🛡️ Starting **December 18**, we're introducing stricter input validation for several mutations to improve security and error handling. The following fields now strictly enforce specific formats. Providing an incorrect value returns a `ValidationRejection` error:

- [`addVirtualIbanEntry`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/add-virtual-iban-entry/): The `accountId` field now accepts **only** a valid UUID.
- [`disableAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/disable-account-membership/) and [`resumeAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/resume-account-membership/): The `accountMembershipId` field now accepts **only** a valid UUID.
- [`resumeAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/resume-account-membership/): The `consentRedirectUrl` field now accepts **only** a valid URL format.
