# Cancel physical cards

If a physical card is lost, stolen, or damaged, or hasn't been delivered, call the `cancelPhysicalCard` mutation and select the reason for canceling the card.

Digital and virtual cards will continue to function.
Refer to guides for [digital](../digital/guide-cancel.mdx) and [virtual](../virtual/guide-cancel.mdx) cards if you need to cancel those as well.

:::caution Lost or stolen cards
If the physical card was lost or stolen, ask the cardholder the following questions:

1. Did the cardholder digitize their physical card?
1. If so, was the cardholder's mobile device lost or stolen?

**If both answers are yes, make sure to cancel their digital cards as well.**
