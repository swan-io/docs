# Account funding

## Overview {#overview}

Account funding is essentially adding money to your Swan account.
You might use account funding if it's the first time you're sending money to your Swan account, or if you'd like to fund your account on a recurring basis from your account at another financial institution.

If you use `requestedExecutionAt` to schedule your funding requests, you can schedule them up to one year in advance.
Your scheduled requests must be for at least two business days in the future.

## Funding sources {#sources}

import AccountFundingDefinition from "../../definitions/_account-funding.mdx";

<AccountFundingDefinition />

Credit transfers and direct debit are both account funding **sources**.

### Credit transfers {#methods-ct}

You can fund your account with two types of credit transfers: SEPA Credit Transfer or Internal Credit Transfer.

Credit transfers are classified as **push payments**, meaning you send money _to_ your Swan account _from_ another source.
Push payments come with no risk because they can't be disputed.

:::info Use a credit transfer
Funding your account with a credit transfer is straightforward with no risk.
Therefore, there aren't guides dedicated to the topic; the following is all you need to know:

Use any bank account in your name to transfer money to your Swan account.
Your Swan IBAN is your identifier.
As soon as the transfer is processed by Swan, it's credited to your account.

You'll see a `SepaCreditTransferIn` transaction on your account history for this transfer with the transaction status `Booked`.

**The remainder of this documentation concerns only direct debit account funding.**
:::

### Direct debit {#methods-dd}

You can fund your account with one pull option: SEPA Direct Debit.

SEPA Direct Debit B2B (business-to-business) can only be used to fund company accounts.
No refunds are authorized for the B2B funding method.

Direct debits are classified as **pull payments**, meaning the money was requested, then sent as a response by the debtor.
Pull payments come with risk because the debtor can dispute the payments.
Using direct debit to fund your account is more complex, so the majority of the documentation is dedicated to these funding sources.

## Payment mandates {#mandates}

import PaymentMandateDefinition from "../../definitions/_payment-mandate.mdx";

> <PaymentMandateDefinition />

Specifically for account funding, the Swan account holder gives Swan explicit permission to pull money from their non-Swan account.
For SEPA Direct Debit B2B, depending on the external institution, the signed payment mandate or payment mandate information must be declared to the user's non-Swan banking institution.

Consenting to the direct debit mandate updates the status to `Enabled` for both the mandate and the funding source.

|       `Rejected`       | Payment mandate was rejected, possibly because the external account's IBAN and Swan payment mandate list different account holders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Rolling reserve {#rolling-reserve}

When using SEPA Direct Debit to fund your account, Swan reserves 100% of your transaction for three business days, after which the reserved amount is released to your account.
Reserved funds are typically released around 20:00 Central European [Summer] Time (CET/CEST) on the last day of the rolling reserve period.
