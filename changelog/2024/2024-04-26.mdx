### Improvements

üí∞ We're supporting additional fees to provide a more flexible billing solution for our partners.
This will allow further customization of our standard fee list, facilitating extra revenue generation. You can [check our public documentation](/topics/accounts/billing/guide-compliant-billing) for further details.

üîÅ Access the `returnReason` when receiving a return transaction for [returned SEPA Credit Transfers](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/#returned) and [reversed SEPA Direct Debits](/topics/payments/direct-debit/#reversed).

‚úÖ Get better visibility about your account holders' ongoing verification processes by going to **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Account holders**.

### Upcoming breaking changes

üí≥ For naming consistency, we deprecated `choosePINCode` in the `printPhysicalCard` mutation and made it optional.
In the coming weeks, choose PINs for your cardholders by using the new optional field `choosePin`.

‚ö†Ô∏è The list of `documentReasonCode` for a `Refused` capital deposit document has been [expanded with nine new values](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/document-reason-code/).
They'll take effect in 4 weeks.
