## Improvements

üì° A new `statusInfo` field has been added to the [`CapitalDepositCase` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/capital-deposit-case/), providing a clearer and more detailed view of each capital deposit's progress.

This new field introduces a single, explicit status that better reflects the case lifecycle, making it easier to track progress. The existing `status` field remains available but is now deprecated. No breaking changes, you can adopt `statusInfo` at your own pace. These changes are also reflected in the Dashboard, though it will continue to display the `status` label.

New granular statuses include:

- **`WaitingForInitialRequirements`**: The case has been initiated and is waiting for shareholder verification, fund transfers, document uploads, and completion of company onboarding.
- **`PendingInternalReview`**: Swan is reviewing the information and documents provided.
- **`WaitingForAdditionalInformation`**: Additional details or corrections have been requested and are pending customer response.

These new statuses replace the former `WaitingForRequirements` status, offering clearer visibility into early-stage capital deposit progress.

üí∞ You can now update a shareholder's deposit amount directly through the API using the new [`updateCapitalDepositShareholderAmount` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/update-capital-deposit-shareholder-amount/). This allows you to easily correct deposit amounts without contacting support. The mutation is available when the capital deposit case is in `WaitingForInitialRequirements`, `PendingInternalReview`, or `WaitingForAdditionalInformation` (or the deprecated `WaitingForRequirements`), and the shareholder status is `PendingOnboarding`, `WaitingForVerification`, or `WaitingForTransfer`. Updating an amount automatically recalculates the total capital deposit.

üè¨ You can now update capital deposit company information directly through the API using the new [`updateCapitalDepositCompany` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/update-capital-deposit-company/). This first version lets you correct the company name and postal address linked to a capital deposit, without contacting support. The mutation is available when the capital deposit case is in `WaitingForInitialRequirements`, `PendingInternalReview`, or `WaitingForAdditionalInformation` (or the deprecated `WaitingForRequirements`), and the company onboarding is finalized.

Updating these fields automatically syncs the data across both the capital deposit case and the associated account holder.

üìÑ You can now manage account statements with more precision:

- A new `Voided` status has been added to indicate an incorrect statement. When a statement is `Voided`, a corrected version is automatically regenerated with the same characteristics to replace it (format, opening and closing dates, and language). This new status is reflected in a more detailed `statusInfo` object, which will replace the previous `status` field (see upcoming breaking changes).
- For better clarity and consistency, several fields have been updated:
  - The generic `fees` field is now split into `feeCredits` (sum of credit fee transactions) and `feeDebits` (sum of debit fee transactions).
  - The `type` field has been replaced with `format`.
- A new webhook is now available to keep you updated on statement changes. [`AccountStatement.Voided`](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/webhook-event-type/) is triggered when a statement is marked as `Voided`.

- The `fees` field is fully replaced by `feeCredits` and `feeDebits`.
- The `status` field is replaced by the new `statusInfo` object.
