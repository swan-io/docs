<h4>New features</h4>

⚡ We implemented a [fallback option](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa#instant-fallback) for Instant SEPA Credit Transfers.
When an instant transfer is unavailable, whether for technical reasons or due to a manual risk assessment, the instant transfer will run as a standard transfer instead.
Your customer won't need to reinitiate a transfer or consent a second time.

- **How?** We added a new input mode to the `initiateCreditTransfer` mutation, as well as the new filter `includeRejectedWithFallback` to the transactions query.
- **Tip**: We recommend you choose `false` by default so your customers won't see the rejected instant transfer on their transaction history.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

📃 To reduce back and forth with our KYC team, we're asking some partners to collect additional supporting documents during onboarding for some use cases:

- Lithuanian companies: Company Registration, UBO Declaration
- Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg companies: UBO Declaration
- German self-employed: Self-employed Registration

🇩🇪 For German account onboarding (`accountCountry: DEU`), three fields are now API-optional:

- UBO birth date: `individualUltimateBeneficialOwners.birthDate`
- UBO birth city: `individualUltimateBeneficialOwners.birthCity`
- UBO birth postal code: `individualUltimateBeneficialOwners.birthCityPostalCode`

📼 We added a new field `originTransaction` to the API at the `transaction` level.
It contains its parent `transaction` (for example, the card debit for a card debit reversal).

🧪 We added Instant SEPA Credit Transfers and their associated recalls to the [Event Simulator](/developers/tools/event-simulator) on your Dashboard.

💳 You can now approve authorizations with a partial amount.
To do so, indicate the `partialAuthorizationAmountValue` within your [payment control](/developers/using-api/payment-control) response.
Note that not all authorizations can be authorized partially; to identify eligible authorizations, look for the `allowsPartialAuthorization:true` on the payment control notification we send you.

<h4>Bug fix</h4>

⚒️ We fixed some latency issues on our OAuth 2.0 server.
Let us know if you still have trouble getting your access tokens.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 We added a new value `SwornStatement` in `SupportingDocumentPurposeEnum`.
To avoid breaking changes on your side, please take these into account.
We'll request this supporting document during onboarding for Spanish companies.
