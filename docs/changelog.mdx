:::

## 23 February 2024

<h3>New features</h3>

‚úÖ Before initiating a credit transfer to a Dutch IBAN from another financial institution, you can now check the account holder's name and account status using the [new `beneficiaryVerification` query](../docs/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/index.mdx#beneficiary-verification).

<h3>Improvements</h3>

üí≥ Order cards in the language of your account.
When ordering cards for an account member not already bound to a user, the card language will be the account language and not English by default.

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

‚ö†Ô∏è To prevent capital deposit failures caused by validation rejections related to shareholder onboarding, we are including the same validation checks as those used for onboarding, and we now answer with a `ValidationRejection`.
This provides more specific and restrictive rejection criteria.

## 09 February 2024

<h3>New features</h3>

üá≥üá± Dutch accounts can now initiate outgoing [Instant SEPA Credit Transfers](../docs/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/index.mdx).

<h3>Improvements</h3>

üìà Performance for your **Dashboard** > **Developers**> **Webhooks** page is improved and now supports all volume and search types.

üí≥ We've improved your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Cards** page with new sorting options.
Sort by creation date and last update.
Also, we added the `addressLine2` in the shipping details.

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

‚ö†Ô∏è As announced in December 2023, all webhooks created before January 2024 are no longer available on your Dashboard following a technical migration.

<h3>Upcoming breaking changes</h3>

üí• For naming consistency, we deprecated the enum value `Recurring` in `InternalPaymentMandateSequence` and `InternalDirectDebitSequence`. Instead, use the new value `Recurrent`.
The deprecated value will be removed in 4 weeks.

‚úÖ We're preparing for changes to the Capital Deposit API, coming in 2 weeks.
Therefore, the API reference for the `createCapitalDepositCase` mutation has been updated to include regex examples.
We're also implementing the same validation checks used for onboarding to provide more specific and strict rejection criteria.

## 27 January 2024

<h3>New features</h3>

üá≥üá± Dutch accounts can now receive incoming [Instant SEPA Credit Transfers](../docs/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/index.mdx). Outgoing instant transfers will be available soon.

üí∏ As part of the European Payment Accounts Directive, we included an annual fees statement in this month's account statement.
This is available on the last page of the PDF automatically generated for January 2024.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

üõ°Ô∏è For security reasons, we added a new screen on the desktop-to-mobile flow when a [user signs up](../docs/topics/users/index.mdx#signup).
They need to confirm their own mobile phone number.

## 19 January 2024

<h3>New features</h3>

üè¶ Swan is now available for [Open Banking aggregators](https://www.swan.io/psd2-api).
They can connect to our API to access the account and transactions.
If you are interested in this, contact us!

<h3>Improvements</h3>

üìÑ Validate a capital deposit case and change the status of capital deposit documents with the Event Simulator or the Testing API.

<h3>Upcoming breaking changes</h3>

‚ö†Ô∏è In 4 weeks, queries using [pagination](../docs/developers/using-api/pagination.mdx) will be limited to 100 elements to load per request.

üí• For API consistency, we deprecated the value `Recurring` for `InternalDirectDebitSequence` and `DirectDebitSequence`.
Please use `Recurrent` instead in the mutations `addInternalDirectDebitPaymentMandate` and `addSepaDirectDebitPaymentMandate`.

## 12 January 2024

<h3>New features</h3>

üåç In February, Swan IBANs will be able to receive incoming SWIFT transfers.
To help you prepare for this new feature, you can test the reception of an incoming International Credit Transfer using our [Testing API](../docs/topics/payments/credit-transfers/international/sandbox.mdx) `simulateIncomingInternationalCreditTransferReception` or Event Simulator.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

üí≥ Card option and spending limit values are displayed in the consent screen language instead of English by default.

üÜî To simulate different stages of the identification process for Sandbox users, you can now use the Event Simulator or the [Testing API](https://explorer.swan.io/?query=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&tab=test-api) with the createSandboxIdentification and updateSandboxIdentification mutations.
Additionally, we deprecated the `identificationStatus` and `identificationLevels` fields when creating and updating Sandbox users from the Dashboard.

## 05 January 2024

<h3>New features</h3>

üá™üá∏ Swan's new Physical Card Issuing Hub in Spain is now live.
Physical card shipment to Spanish end-customers now takes less time!
Please contact your account manager if you're interested.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

üìÑ We've added `accountHolder` and `onboarding` in the `supportingDocumentCollection` query to allow you to stop collecting documents via e-mail.
It's more integrated and efficient, making follow-up easier.
You also get better visibility on document collection throughout the onboarding process (status, content ‚Ä¶).

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

‚ö†Ô∏è We've added new values to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum: `LegalRepresentativeProofOfIdentity`, `UltimateBeneficialOwnerProofOfIdentity`, `NIFAccreditationCard`, `PresidentDecisionOfAppointment`, `AdministratorDecisionOfAppointment`, and `FinancialStatements`.
We're also deprecating `ProofOfIdentity`.
