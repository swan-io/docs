## Swan protects you and your users {#protect}

Your protection is Swan's priority.
Consider the following ways in which Swan keeps you and your users safe.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Area</th>
    <th>Protection</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">üí¨ **Contact with your users** ‚àó</td>
    <td>Swan never calls your users without previously notifying them. If a user receives an unexpected phone call from Swan, strongly encourage them to hang up and inform you and Swan immediately.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To keep communication with you and your users secure, Swan prefers that both you and your users open tickets instead of emailing Support. The [partner](https://partner-support.swan.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new) and [end-user](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18444696903837) support forms initiate a secure way to communicate about sensitive topics.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Swan doesn't request sensitive personal or account information by phone or email. Your users might be asked to verify their name or phone number, but nothing more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">üîê **Authentication** and **Consent**</td>
    <td>To access Swan platforms, you and your users must [log in](../../topics/users/index.mdx#login). If there's no activity for a set time period, you're [automatically logged out](../../developers/index.mdx#ttl) to ensure the security of your account.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Swan uses a mix of biometrics, passcodes, and one-time passwords to secure access to Swan platforms.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You and your users must [consent](../../topics/users/consent/index.mdx#sensitive) to all sensitive operations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">üí∂ **Payments**</td>
    <td>Swan offers [single-use virtual cards (SUVs)](../../topics/cards/virtual/index.mdx#suv). Consider prioritizing issuing SUVs as it's more difficult to use them fraudulently.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You and your users can save [trusted beneficiaries](../../topics/payments/credit-transfers/index.mdx#beneficiaries). Only eligible account members can send credit transfers to unsaved beneficiaries.</td>
  </tr>
  <td>When making online payments, you and your users must complete [3-D Secure (3DS)](../../topics/payments/cards/index.mdx#3ds), an extra security layer when paying online. Please note that 3DS might be bypassed if Mastercard deems a payment low risk.</td>

‚àó *You, your users, and Swan each have a direct relationship due to the [three-party partnership model](../index.mdx#model).
As a result, Swan contacts your users directly, when necessary, respecting strict privacy guidelines.*

## Common types of fraud {#types}

<details>
  <summary>Account takeover (ATO) fraud</summary>
  <div>
Account takeover fraud occurs when those committing fraud gain control of a victim's payment account, and then use the account to perform unauthorized actions.

:::info Tips to combat ATO fraud
- Keep account **login information secure**.
- Use **strong, unique passwords** and passcodes.
- **Don't share account details** by email, phone call, or text message.
- Set up **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** or **two-factor authentication (2FA)** as an extra layer of security in case credentials are compromised by a phishing attack.
- Only access the account from **trusted and secure networks**.
:::
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Card fraud</summary>
  <div>
Those committing card fraud **steal virtual card details**, such as card numbers and card verification values or codes (CVVs or CVCs), or **actual physical cards**.
Then, they use that information to make payments online or by phone, where the purchaser's physical card or presence isn't required.

Types of card fraud include **remote purchase fraud**, **card not present (CNP) fraud**, and any activity with **lost**, **stolen**, or **misplaced cards**.

:::info Tips to combat card fraud
- Only enter card details on websites with a **secure connection**.
- Only enter the card number and security code into **fields designed for those numbers**. Don't enter card details in free-text fields, which are open for any type of text input.
- **Block (cancel) lost or stolen cards immediately**. If you use Swan's Web Banking, send your users the [Support Center article about blocking cards](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/18538920070045-Blocking-your-card).
- Prioritize issuing [single-use virtual cards](../../topics/cards/virtual/index.mdx#suv) for non-recurring online payments because these cards are more difficult to use fraudulently.

  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Chief Executive Officer (CEO) fraud</summary>
  <div>
CEO fraud is a cybercrime where individuals impersonate a company's CEO or other top executive.
It's a type of authorized push payment (APP) fraud and also known as business email compromise (BEC).

These individuals send **convincing emails** to company employees that seem to require **immediate and urgent attention**.
In the email, they might ask the employee to transfer funds, provide access to secure portals or documents, or otherwise reveal confidential information about the company.

Consider the following example of a CEO vishing attack:

> Subject: Urgent financial matter (confidential)
>
> Hi Alex,
>
> There's been an urgent development and we need to pay an invoice immediately.
> I'm in a critical meeting and can't send this transaction myself.
> Could you please handle this right away?
>
> *includes transfer details*
>
> Let me know when it's done.
>
> Thanks,<br />
> Jules<br />
> CEO, MyBrand
<br />

:::info Tips to combat CEO fraud
- **Confirm the email address**. Is there a spelling error or typo in the executive's name? Are there extra characters, letters, or numbers in the domain name?
- If you've received other emails from this executive, **does this email look like the others**? Or are there slight differences in style, spacing, and voice?
- Even when a request comes from an executive, **never bypass established security measures**.
- **Contact the executive using another channel**. If you received an email, for example, try calling or sending them a direct message on the company's messaging platform.

  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Invoice and billing fraud</summary>
  <div>
Invoice and billing fraud involves the use of fake invoices to trick companies.

Fraudulent individuals might **send companies fake invoices** that appear to be from the company's regular suppliers.
These invoices often **look authentic**, complete with logos and other details.
However, the **bank account details** included on the invoice **belong to the fraudulent individuals** rather than a legitimate supplier.

:::info Tips to combat invoice and billing fraud
- **Establish and respect rigorous processes**, including: purchase verification systems, payment validation processes, transaction verification methods, and more.
- Regularly **verify supplier credentials**.
- **Maintain strong, direct lines of communication** with suppliers, and contact the supplier directly in case of suspicion.
:::
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Phishing, vishing, and smishing fraud</summary>
  <div>
Phishing, vishing, and smishing involve fraudulent individuals **impersonating legitimate organizations**, such as companies or governmental agencies, contacting you by email, phone, or text message.
All three are types of authorized push payment (APP) fraud.

- **Phishing** ‚Üí email ‚úâÔ∏è
- **Vishing** ‚Üí phone call üìû
- **Smishing** ‚Üí text message üí¨

They attempt to **steal sensitive information**, including user names and passwords, government ID numbers, financial information, and more.
These emails, phone calls, and text messages can be **quite convincing**.
For example, email and text messages often link to websites that look almost identical to an organization's real website.

:::info Tips to combat phishing, vishing, and smishing fraud
- Don't provide information or funds **urgently**.
- **Contact the organization directly** using a different communication channel to ask them about the suspicious message. For example, if they contacted you by phone, send an email. If you received a text message, call them.
- **Check links before you open them**. Is there a spelling error or typo in the domain name? Are there extra characters, letters, or numbers in the link?
- **Open websites directly** in your browser instead of clicking links included in an email or text message.
- Set up **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** or **two-factor authentication (2FA)** as an extra layer of security in case credentials are compromised by an attack.

If you or your users suspect fraud, **please react immediately**.
Remember, Swan never contacts you or your users to transfer money outside of established channels through Swan Support.
As a Swan Partner, you also shouldn't contact your users to transfer money.

:::caution Communication channels
If something feels urgent, your users should contact the requester through a second communication channel.
For example, if they **received an email request**, they should **call** the person requesting the information or transfer.
:::

Swan invites you and your users to **be SAFE, not sorry**, borrowing from the [Yale University Information Security Office](https://cybersecurity.yale.edu/).
Encourage the following behavior from your users, and practice it yourselves.

| Action | Explanation |
| :---: | --- |
| **`S`**<br />**See something suspicious?** | Be alert for situations that feel urgent or questionable in any way. Here are a few examples of suspicious incidents:<br /><br /><ul><li>You receive an urgent email from your company's CEO asking you to transfer money outside of the normal process.</li><li>You're not shopping online with your Swan virtual card, but you receive an unexpected text message asking you to consent to a transaction.</li><li>Someone calls you on your personal phone claiming to be a reputable charity association, but asks for a donation in a strange way.</li><li>You receive an unexpected invoice with payment details you don't recognize.</li></ul> |
| **`A`**<br />**Act quickly.** | [Report](#report) the incident to Swan right away. Don't wait, don't be embarrassed, and don't let someone talk you out of your gut feeling about the incident.<br /><br />However, don't act on the request quickly. Wait to transfer funds or provide information until you know it's not a scam.  |
| **`F`**<br />**Follow instructions.** | Provide Swan with all requested information as quickly as possible. Stay responsive as Swan follows up on the incident. |
| **`E`**<br />**Exercise discretion.** | Be careful until you know the account is secure. [Reset passcodes](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/20531243310749), limit [account membership permissions](../../topics/accounts/memberships/index.mdx#permissions), and anything else you feel might protect you until the incident is resolved. |
