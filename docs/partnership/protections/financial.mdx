# Protecting funds

Regardless of what happens to Swan, **your money is always secure**.

This is a non-negotiable requirement of all [e-money licenses](../index.mdx#license) that Swan takes seriously.
Swan protects you and all of your accounts holders with a safeguarding account that offers **two layers of protection**.

<TrustCenter />

## Layer 1: Safeguarding account {#protecting-funds-account}

All funds belonging to Swan account holders are safeguarded in an account at BNP Paribas, completely separate from Swan's accounts.

- E-money institutions are **required to hold onto your funds**, meaning Swan **can't invest them**.
- Therefore, **all of your funds** are in this safeguarding account.
- In the case that Swan goes bankrupt, your funds are **secure** at the safeguarding bank.

## Layer 2: Crisis operator {#protecting-funds-operator}

In the case that Swan's safeguarding bank goes bankrupt, the [Fonds de Garantie des Dépôts et de Résolution (FGDR)](https://www.garantiedesdepots.fr/en) **protects each account holder for up to €100 000** (one hundred thousand euros).
In English, FGDR translates to *Deposit Guarantee and Resolution Fund*, and it's a French fund that extends to all accounts at French e-money institutions.

- The FGDR applies to individuals and companies (natural and legal persons) with a few exceptions (for example, banks as legal persons).
- If Swan's safeguarding bank goes bankrupt, Swan's ledger will be the single source of truth and all account holders, regardless of nationality, will be reimbursed by the FGDR.
