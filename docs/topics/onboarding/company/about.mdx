## Company onboarding form

The company onboarding form begins by gathering preliminary details about the company.
Then, Swan collects the following information:

1. User's **email address**.
1. Legal information about the organization, including the **company name**, **registration number** (optional), **VAT number** (optional), and **address**, as well as details about the organization's **activity** and **expected monthly volume**.
1. Information about the company's **ultimate beneficial owners** (UBO).
This step only applies if the user selected **company**, **home owner association**, or **other** when submitting their preliminary details.
1. **Required documents** to verify your organization. You might not see this step in your onboarding process.
1. **Consent** to open the account (consent process requires a mobile device).

## Identify verification recommendations

Swan must verify the identity of the legal representative for each company.
Swan supports multiple types of identity verification, called `identificationLevels` in the API.

For company onboarding, the following levels are recommended based on the account country.
Please refer to the [section on identity verification](https://docs.swan.io/concept/user#identification-level) for more information on identification levels.

| :de: Germany | ✓ **Expert** | QES |
| :flag-nl: Netherlands | ✓ **Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| :es: Spain | ✓ **Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
