## Saved beneficiaries {#saved-beneficiaries}

VOP integrates seamlessly with Swan's [trusted beneficiary system](./guide-add-beneficiary.mdx) to streamline repeat payments while maintaining compliance.

### First-time verification for saved beneficiaries {#verify-saved}

**Important**: Even saved beneficiaries require VOP verification for compliance after October 9, 2025.

**Workflow for existing saved beneficiaries:**
1. Retrieve saved beneficiary details from your system
2. Call [`verifySepaBeneficiary`](#verify-mutation) with the saved IBAN and name
3. [Use the verification token](#use-token) when initiating the transfer
4. Future payments to the same beneficiary will still require verification

**Benefits of this approach:**
- **Compliance**: Meets mandatory VOP requirements
- **User experience**: Familiar beneficiary selection with added security
- **Fraud prevention**: Validates beneficiary details haven't changed

### Save during verification {#save-during-verification}

You can save new beneficiaries while performing verification by setting `save: true` in the credit transfer mutation:

```graphql {11}
mutation InitiateWithVerificationAndSave {
  initiateCreditTransfers(
    input: {
      accountId: "$YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
      consentRedirectUrl: "$YOUR_REDIRECT_URL"
      creditTransfers: {
        amount: { value: "100", currency: "EUR" }
        sepaBeneficiary: {
          iban: "FR0000000000300000000056H80"
          name: "John Smith"
          verificationToken: "vf_01234567890abcdef"
          isMyOwnIban: false
          save: true
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    # ... response handling
  }
}
```

This creates a trusted beneficiary record while demonstrating VOP compliance.
