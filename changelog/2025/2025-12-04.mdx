## New features

🤖 Swan's new [MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers](/developers/tools/mcp-servers) give AI assistants direct access to Swan's GraphQL schema and documentation. Use them with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or Cursor to generate accurate queries and get answers about the API.

## Improvements

🔗 Your users can now upload merchant profile supporting documents directly in Web Banking. Retrieve the upload URL from [`supportingDocumentCollectionUrl`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-collection/#supportingdocumentcollectionsupportingdocumentcollectionurlstring--) in the [`SupportingDocumentCollection`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-collection/) object and share it with them.

📩 Several email notifications now support your project's branding (logo, accent colors):

- **[Account onboarding](/topics/onboarding/#notifications)**: Your account terms and conditions.
- **[Account holder verification](/topics/onboarding/account-holders#notifications)**: First transfer, Request supporting documents, Request supporting documents reminders, Your account is opened.

Account holder verification notifications can be configured with your Account Manager. Your current configuration has been applied automatically to avoid disruptions.

📈 The Insights tab on your Dashboard now includes new visualizations:

- **Capital deposits**: New section tracking deposit status, total lead time, and step duration.
- **KYC multi-touch lead time**: New graph tracking total verification time for complex cases. The "One-touch vs. multi-touch" graph now focuses on completed processes, with iterations simplified to match SLAs ("Within 9 hours" vs. "More than 9 hours").

*Coming soon: Support operations graphs.*

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🛡️ Starting **December 18**, we're introducing stricter input validation for several mutations to improve security and error handling. The following fields now enforce specific formats, returning a `ValidationRejection` for invalid values:

| Mutation | Field | Required format |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| [`addVirtualIbanEntry`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/add-virtual-iban-entry/) | `accountId` | Valid UUID |
| [`disableAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/disable-account-membership/) | `accountMembershipId` | Valid UUID |
| [`resumeAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/resume-account-membership/) | `accountMembershipId` | Valid UUID |
| [`resumeAccountMembership`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/resume-account-membership/) | `consentRedirectUrl` | Valid URL |

📩 Starting **December 18**, [account membership invitations](/topics/accounts/memberships/#notifications) migrate to the branded notification template (logo, accent colors). If you use a forked version of Web Banking, fetch and deploy the latest version from Swan's repository to continue receiving Swan-sent invitation emails.
