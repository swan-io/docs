## Collecting onboarding information {#collect-info}

Company onboarding information can be sumbitted **with the API** or through **Swan's onboarding form**.

| Method | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Onboarding form | The onboarding form collects:<br /><br /><ol><li>User's **email address**.</li><li>Legal information about the organization, including the **company name**, **registration number** (optional), **VAT number** (optional), and **address**, as well as details about the organization's **activity** and **expected monthly volume**.</li><li>Information about the company's **ultimate beneficial owners** (UBO). This step only applies if the user selected **company**, **home owner association**, or **other** when submitting their preliminary details.</li><li>**Required documents** to verify your organization. You might not see this step in your onboarding process.</li><li>User [**signs up**](../../users/index.mdx#signup) for Swan.</li></ol>You can also customize this form to better meet your needs. Review to Swan's [open source documentation](https://swan-io.github.io/swan-partner-frontend/specs/onboarding/company/), then ask your Technical Account Manager for more information. |
| API | The API collects the same information as the onboarding form. Please review the requirements explained on this page throughly, then follow the guide to [create a company onboarding link](./guide-create.mdx). |

### Expected monthly volume {#monthly-volume}

Swan uses the expected monthly volume provided during onboarding to monitor the account.
It's essential to select the range that corresponds to the company's actual volume, and to notify Swan if that expected monthly volume changes during the account's lifecycle.

If you use Swan's onboarding form, this information is collected by default.
If you design your own form, please offer the following ranges:

- Less than 10 000â‚¬ (`LessThan10000`)
- Between 10 000â‚¬ and 50 000â‚¬ (`Between10000And50000`)
- Between 50 000â‚¬ and 100 000â‚¬ (`Between50000And100000`)
- More than 100 000â‚¬ (`MoreThan100000`)

### Ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) {#ubo}

Providing information for at least one UBO is **mandatory for all companies**.
Swan allows two types of UBOs:

- Ownership of capital UBO
- Legal representative UBO

#### Ownership of capital UBO {#ubo-owner}

An **ownership of capital UBO** is anyone holding more than 25% of that company's value, whether directly or indirectly.
Providing information for **all** UBOs owning 25% or more of a company is a **legal requirement**.

**Direct ownership** is the most straightforward form of ownership and means the UBO owns shares or stakes directly in the company.
They are listed as a shareholder on company records.
**Indirect ownership** means the UBO owns shares or stakes through other entities, such as trusts or parent companies.
They may control or have rights to the company without their names being listed directly on company records.

:::tip 
With the API, set `type` to `HasCapital`.
On the onboarding form, choose `Ownership of capital` for type of control exercised.
Always include how much capital they own and whether they own it directly or indirectly.
:::

#### Legal representative UBO {#ubo-legal-representative}

A **legal representative UBO** serves as the company's default UBO if a company doesn't have any UBOs who hold more than 25% of the company.
Providing information for one legal representative UBO is required if the company has zero ownership of capital UBOs.

:::tip 
With the API, set `type` to `LegalRepresentative`.
On the onboarding form, choose `Legal representative` for type of control exercised.
No other additional information is required in the UBO section for legal representative UBOs.
:::

### Country-specific information {#country-info}

Requested information can change based on your account country.
Refer to the [tables later on this page](#country-reqs) for country-specific requirements.

## Identification recommendations {#identification-recommendations}

Swan must verify the identity of the [legal representative](../../../glossary.mdx#legal-representative) for each company.
Swan supports multiple [**identification processes**](../../users/identifications/index.mdx#levels-processes), and some require a [**first transfer**](../account-holders/index.mdx#first-transfer).
For company onboarding, the following levels are recommended based on the account country.

| Account country | Recommended level for legal representative | Other supported levels |
|---|---|---|
| ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France | **âœ“ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany | **âœ“ Expert** | QES |
| ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy | **âœ“ QES** | Expert + first transfer |
| ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Netherlands | **âœ“ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain | **âœ“ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |

:::info Self-employed account holders
- **France unregistered self-employed**: PVID, or Expert and first transfer to your Swan account (QES is technically accepted but not preferred)
- **France registered self-employed**: Expert
- **Germany self-employed**: QES and first transfer to your Swan account
:::

## Country requirements for company accounts {#country-reqs}
