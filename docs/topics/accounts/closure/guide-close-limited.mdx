title: Close a limited account

# Close a `Limited` account {#limited}

## Step 1: Submit closure request {#limited-submit}

import SubmitClosureRequestLimited from "./_partner-close-account.mdx";

<SubmitClosureRequestLimited />

## Step 2: Swan reviews request {#limited-review}

For `Limited` accounts, consent from the account holder isn't required.
Therefore, Swan proceeds with account closure without contacting the account holder.

Before changing the account status to `Closing`, Swan confirms several details:

1. If the **account status** is `Suspended`, the account holder is already communicating with Swan about the suspension. The same Swan team takes over account closure.
1. If the account balance is **positive**, or if **transactions** have already been made from the account, Swan follows the process to close an `Unlimited` account instead.
1. If the account balance is **negative**, Swan can't close the account.

## Step 3: Swan changes account status {#limited-status}

If the process to close the account doesn't need to change based on details confirmed in step 2, Swan changes the account status to `Closing`.

Since the account was never used, passing from `Closing` to `Closed` happens quickly; there isn't a required notice period.
