# Merchant onboarding

To accept payments, you need to request a merchant profile and at least one merchant payment method.
Both must be `Enabled` before your merchant can start accepting payments.

## Guide {#guide}

1. Request a merchant profile for your account holder.
1. Request at least one merchant payment method.
1. Provide missing information if required.
1. Test your integration in Sandbox.

### Step 1: Request a merchant profile {#step-1}

Request a merchant profile for your account holder using the API.

Refer to the guide: [Request a merchant profile](./profiles/guide-request.mdx).

:::tip Payment methods required
Your merchant profile will only be reviewed after you request at least one payment method.
:::

### Step 2: Request a merchant payment method {#step-2}

You need at least one payment method enabled to receive payments.
Your merchant profile will only be reviewed after you have requested at least one payment method.

Choose the payment methods that fit your merchant's business model:

- [Cards](./online/cards/guide-request.mdx)
- [SEPA Direct Debit](./online/sdd/guide-request.mdx)
- [Internal Direct Debit](./online/idd/guide-request.mdx)
- [French checks](./online/checks/guide-request.mdx)

### Step 3: Provide missing information {#step-3}

If some information is missing, your merchant payment method will have the status `WaitingForInformation`.
Along with this status, you will have a list of verification requirements and supporting documents that need to be shared.

:::info Merchant profile level
All information is provided at the merchant profile level because it may be needed for more than one payment method.
This avoids asking for the same information again.

Refer to the guide: [Provide missing information](./guide-missing-information.mdx).

### Step 4: Test your integration {#step-4}
