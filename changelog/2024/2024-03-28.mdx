### Improvements

📃 Use the newly introduced **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Onboarding** > **Supporting documents** page to manage the document collection during the account opening process.
Learn more about the [supporting document collection](/topics/onboarding/documents).

🧪 [Simulate](/topics/onboarding/documents/sandbox) a supporting document status update.

⏸️ Suspending an account now triggers an `Account.Updated` webhook.

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ In **2 weeks**, we'll reject any input of the "\_" character in the `reference` field, and sanitize it in the `label` field within the `initiateCreditTransfers` mutation, as it's not authorized in SEPA messages.
For the `reference` field, ensure that the content:

- Doesn't start or end with a "/"
- Doesn't have "//"
- Follows this pattern: (regex [A-Za-z0-9 -?.+,/’])

💸 The `beneficiaryId` input field for the mutation `initiateCreditTransfers` has been deprecated, and will be removed in 4 weeks.

ℹ️ In the upcoming months, we'll remove the requirement of one unique phone number per user.
While each phone number will remain linked to only one user at a time, it can **later** be reused by different users, like employees, at **separate** times.
