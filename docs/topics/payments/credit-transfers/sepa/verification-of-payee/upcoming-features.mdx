# Upcoming VoP Features

Swan's VoP implementation will expand with additional capabilities beyond the foundational single credit transfer functionality.

:::info Current availability
The features on this page are **not yet available**. They are planned for future releases following the initial VoP launch on October 9, 2025.
:::

## Standing Order Verification {#standing-orders}

**Coming Soon**: VoP integration with standing orders

VoP will be required only when scheduling a standing order, not for subsequent executions:

- âœ… **Setup**: VoP verification required
- âœ… **First payment**: Uses verification from setup  
- âœ… **Recurring payments**: No additional VoP needed

### Enhanced scheduleStandingOrder

```graphql
scheduleStandingOrder(
  input: {
    # ... standard standing order fields
    beneficiaryVerificationToken: "vt_abc123..."  # Coming soon
  }
) {
  # ... response payload
}
```

Per the Instant Payments Regulation, this streamlined approach reduces verification overhead for recurring payments while maintaining fraud protection at setup.

## Bulk Payment Optimization {#bulk-payments}

**Coming Soon**: Advanced bulk transfer capabilities

### Pre-verification Workflows

Verify multiple beneficiaries efficiently before initiating bulk payments:

```graphql
# Future capability
verifySepaBeneficiary(
  input: {
    accountId: "$YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
    payees: [
      { iban: "...", name: "Supplier 1" },
      { iban: "...", name: "Supplier 2" },
      { iban: "...", name: "Supplier 3" }
      # Up to 50 beneficiaries per call
    ]
  }
)
```

### Token Management Strategies

Advanced token lifecycle management:

- **Automatic refresh**: Re-verify tokens approaching expiry
- **Bulk token usage**: Optimize multiple transfers with cached verifications
- **Performance analytics**: Track verification success rates and timing

## Company Verification {#company-verification}

**Coming Soon**: Legal entity verification workflows

### Enhanced Company Support

  externalReference: String
