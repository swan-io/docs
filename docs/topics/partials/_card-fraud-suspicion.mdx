:::caution suspicion of fraud
At the slightest suspicion of fraud, block all eCommerce payments temporarily by updating `eCommerce` to `false` for the concerned card product.

Additionally, physical cards can be temporarily blocked (suspended) and both the virtual and physical cards can be permanently blocked (canceled). 

The card holder then needs to email support@swan.io, after which Swan can issue a new card.
