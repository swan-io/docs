### Breaking changes

🆔 It's been 3 months now (that's 3 releases ago), that partners integrating by API must make sure their UX [entices users to prove their identity](/topics/users/identifications). To give you time to develop this user flow, we've been texting all users about identity verification as soon as they are created. Starting today, we no longer send new users this sms.
