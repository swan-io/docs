import OnboardingOverview from '../partials/_overview.mdx';

<OnboardingOverview accountType="a company" />

## Collecting onboarding information {#collect-info}

Company onboarding information can be sumbitted **with the API** or through **Swan's onboarding form**.

| Method | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Onboarding form | The onboarding form collects:<br /><br /><ol><li>User's **email address**.</li><li>Legal information about the organization, including the **company name**, **registration number** (optional), **VAT number** (optional), and **address**, as well as details about the organization's **activity** and **expected monthly volume**.</li><li>Information about the company's **ultimate beneficial owners** (UBO). This step only applies if the user selected **company**, **home owner association**, or **other** when submitting their preliminary details.</li><li>**Required documents** to verify your organization. You might not see this step in your onboarding process.</li><li>User [**signs up**](../../users/index.mdx#signup) for Swan.</li></ol>You can also customize this form to better meet your needs. Review to Swan's [open source documentation](https://swan-io.github.io/swan-partner-frontend/specs/onboarding/company/), then ask your Technical Account Manager for more information. |
| API | The API collects the same information as the onboarding form. Please review the requirements explained on this page throughly, then follow the guide to [create a company onboarding link](./guide-create.mdx). |

### Expected monthly volume {#monthly-volume}

Swan uses the expected monthly volume provided during onboarding to monitor the account.
It's essential to select the range that corresponds to the company's actual volume, and to notify Swan if that expected monthly volume changes during the account's lifecycle.

If you use Swan's onboarding form, this information is collected by default.
If you design your own form, please offer the following ranges:

- Less than 10 000€ (`LessThan10000`)
- Between 10 000€ and 50 000€ (`Between10000And50000`)
- Between 50 000€ and 100 000€ (`Between50000And100000`)
- More than 100 000€ (`MoreThan100000`)

### Ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) {#ubo}

Providing information for at least one UBO is **mandatory for all companies**.
Swan allows two types of UBOs:

- Ownership of capital UBO
- Legal representative UBO

#### Ownership of capital UBO {#ubo-owner}

An **ownership of capital UBO** is anyone holding more than 25% of that company's value, whether directly or indirectly.
Providing information for **all** UBOs owning 25% or more of a company is a **legal requirement**.

**Direct ownership** is the most straightforward form of ownership and means the UBO owns shares or stakes directly in the company.
They are listed as a shareholder on company records.
**Indirect ownership** means the UBO owns shares or stakes through other entities, such as trusts or parent companies.
They may control or have rights to the company without their names being listed directly on company records.

:::tip 
With the API, set `type` to `HasCapital`.
On the onboarding form, choose `Ownership of capital` for type of control exercised.
Always include how much capital they own and whether they own it directly or indirectly.
:::

#### Legal representative UBO {#ubo-legal-representative}

A **legal representative UBO** serves as the company's default UBO if a company doesn't have any UBOs who hold more than 25% of the company.
Providing information for one legal representative UBO is required if the company has zero ownership of capital UBOs.

:::tip 
With the API, set `type` to `LegalRepresentative`.
On the onboarding form, choose `Legal representative` for type of control exercised.
No other additional information is required in the UBO section for legal representative UBOs.
:::

### Retrieving information automatically {#auto-retrieve}

For companies with  🇫🇷 France as their [account country](../../accounts/index.mdx#account-country), Swan retrieves most information automatically after you provide the company's registration number.
By allowing Swan to retrieve the information, you can avoid asking your users for certain details.

To trigger automatic retrieval, `residencyAddress.country` must be `FRA` and the `registrationNumber` must be provided.

For information about ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) and legal representatives, one of the following happens:

- If you **provide** UBO and legal representative information, Swan doesn't override it with information from the business registry.
- If you **don't provide** UBO and legal representative information, Swan creates the objects and adds the information retrieved from the registry.

For all information *not* related to UBOs or legal representatives, how Swan uses the retrieved information depends on whether you're creating or updating an onboarding.

| Event | Retrieved information behavior | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Create** an onboarding | If you provide some information manually, Swan adds the retrieved information for everything except the information you provided.<br /><br />If you only provide mandatory information, Swan fills in the rest. | You: <ul><li>Provide the mandatory `residencyAddress.country` and `registrationNumber`.</li><li>Provide the `vatNumber`, which could be retrieved from the registry.</li></ul>Swan: <ul><li>Keeps the `vatNumber` you provided.</li><li>Fills in all other fields with the retrieved information.</li></ul> |
| **Update** an onboarding | Swan overrides any information you provided manually when creating the onboarding with information from the registry, unless you provide it again. | You: <ul><li>Specify the `language`.</li><li>Don't provide the `vatNumber` again.</li></ul>Swan: <ul><li>Replaces the `vatNumber` you provided when creating the onboarding with the `vatNumber` retrieved from the registry.</li><li>Saves the `language` information.</li></ul> |

## Identification recommendations {#identification-recommendations}

Swan must verify the identity of the [legal representative](../../../glossary.mdx#legal-representative) for each company.
Swan supports multiple [identification processes](../../users/identifications/index.mdx#levels-processes), and some require a [first transfer](../account-holders/index.mdx#first-transfer).
For company onboarding, the following levels are recommended based on the account country.

| Account country | Recommended level for legal representative | Other supported levels |
|---|---|---|
| 🇫🇷 France | **✓ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| 🇩🇪 Germany | **✓ Expert** | QES |
| 🇮🇹 Italy | **✓ QES** | Expert + first transfer |
| 🇳🇱 Netherlands | **✓ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| 🇪🇸 Spain | **✓ Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |

## Country requirements for company accounts {#country-reqs}
