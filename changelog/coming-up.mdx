  <div>
üîê Starting **July 10th**, failed consent attempts will trigger the `Consent.Failed` webhook. 
Previously, failed consents triggered `Consent.Granted`, due to a bug. The new webhook is already available in your Dashboard.

‚úâÔ∏è Starting **July 21st**, the `shippingProvider` field in `PhysicalCardToActivateStatusInfo` and `PhysicalCardRenewedStatusInfo` will be migrated from a `String` to an `ENUM`. 
On the same day, the [shipping provider](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/shipping-provider/) values `La Poste` and `CORREOS` will be removed.

üí∂ On **August 1st**, we're removing the `merchantPayment` field in the `InitiateCheckMerchantPaymentSuccessPayload`, use [`checkMerchantPayment`](/topics/merchants/online/checks/guide-initiate) instead. We're also deprecating `merchantPayment`.
