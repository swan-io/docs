Generally, accepting payments with direct debit instead of credit transfers improves convenience, accuracy, and cash flow for merchants.

1. **Convenience**
    - After a customer agrees to a recurring direct debit transaction, the payments are automatically debited from their account on the agreed-upon date.
    - This reduces manual intervention for each transaction. For certain verticals (rental management, for example), an automated debit is common practice and makes sense for the debtor and the merchant.
1. **Accuracy**
    - With direct debit, there is less chance that a payment is late, for the incorrect amount, or even sent to the wrong merchant. As a result, direct debit also helps make reconciliation use cases easier.
1. **Improved cash flow**
    - Merchants can plan for payment arrival and amount. This means they can better predict and control their revenue flow, which leads to more accurate financial planning.
