# Sandbox for card payments

When testing your integration, you might need to simulate certain events with the [Event Simulator](../../../developers/tools/event-simulator.mdx).

:::tip 
Use the Event Simulator to **test other events** related to card payments, such as receiving incoming and outgoing card payments, reversing incoming and outgoing card payments, and more.

Simulating receiving authorization for a card payment by entering testing data...

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Developers** > **Event Simulator**.

1. Enter any testing data you'd like to include in the simulation, such as a merchant or terminal ID, a valid merchant category code, a location, and more.
1. Change the transaction category, authorization type, outcome, and card type to test different situations.
1. Click **Simulate**.
1. After clicking **Simulate**, notice the status change to `Success`, meaning your authorization request was successful.
