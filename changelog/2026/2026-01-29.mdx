📅 Set card spending limits based on calendar periods (resetting monthly on the 1st, weekly on Monday, or daily at midnight) instead of rolling periods. Calendar-based limits make it easier for finance teams to control budgets by calendar month, week, or day. Configure calendar limits using the new `mode` field in [`SpendingLimitInput`](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/spending-limit-input/) with options for `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly` calendar recurrence.
