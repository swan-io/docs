## New features

💳 Here's my new feature.

## Improvements

🧭 Here's my improvement.

🧭 When using the `verifyBeneficiary` mutation, the beneficiary name for a SEPA beneficiary and Swan account must now be 70 characters or fewer. This matches the maximum length supported for SEPA Credit Transfer initiations, preventing rejections.

💳 When the cardholder of a recurring `SingleUseVirtualCard` leaves the account and their membership is revoked, the card is automatically reassigned to the account's Legal Representative and remains active, ensuring their expenses are not interrupted.

## Updates

🔗 Starting December 1st, Swan Support will no longer manually register SEPA Direct Debit B2B mandates. Going forward, you can share a SEPA Direct Debit B2B mandate registration link directly with your users or embed it in your application, or use our API.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ Here's my upcoming breaking change.

🧹 On **December 1st**, the deprecated `companyInfoBySiren` query will be removed. Its behavior has been included in the onboarding creation and update flows since earlier this year.

🧹 On **February 5th, 2026**, the deprecated `status` field will be removed from the `CapitalDepositCase` object. Use the `statusInfo` field instead, introduced on October 23rd, which provides more granular and descriptive status updates for capital deposit cases.

## Reminders

ℹ️ Here's my reminder.
