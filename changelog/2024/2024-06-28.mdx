### New

ü§ùüèæ Visit the new [Swan Trust Center](https://trust.swan.io/) to learn how Swan keeps you, your users, and Swan secure.
Understand security measures in depth, review policies, and find answers to frequent security questions.

### Improvements

üîé Search **account holders** by account holder ID on your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Account holders**.
You will need to enter the full account holder ID.

üîÄ To ensure the best identification experience for your users, set the `identificationLevel` to `Auto` when [constructing your authorization URL](/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user/#url-parameters-optional).
This lets Swan choose the best flow for your user's situation.
Using `Auto` is ideal if you include the `onboardingId` in the authorization URL, or if you're trying to reengage your user to [complete identification](/topics/users/identifications).

### Breaking changes

‚ö†Ô∏è As announced on [May 24th](./2024-05-24.mdx), the `notStarted` [identification status](/topics/users/identifications/#statuses) was removed.
Instead, use `Started` to streamline identification flows and reduce confusion.<br />
*Nothing changed for [account holder verification statuses](/topics/onboarding/account-holders/#verification-process-statuses).*
