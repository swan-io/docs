## New features

💳 [**Payment Control**](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/payment-control/) now supports 0€ authorizations and credit authorizations, identifiable with [`TransactionSide!`](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/transaction-side/) as `Credit`. Activate this feature from your **Dashboard** > **Developers** > **Payment control**.

🔑 **Idempotency** is now available for `initiateCreditTransfers`. Add an [idempotency key](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/idempotency/#idempotency-key-requirements) to your transfer queries to improve reliability and prevent duplicate transactions.

📥 You can now [export transaction data](<!--/topics/payments/overview/guide-export/-->) in `.csv` format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportTransactionData` mutation.

## Improvements

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 [**Server-to-server consent**](https://docs.swan.io/topics/users/consent/#s2s) is now available for all account membership [mutations](https://docs.swan.io/topics/users/consent/#sensitive), enabling you to reduce manual operations and scale more easily.

🔢 A new `Service` section has been added to your **Dashboard** > **Insights** to provide data on KYC and Transaction Monitoring volumes and SLAs. Some data was moved from the `Onboarding` section to `Service`.

## API updates

### Reminders

🧭 As announced on July 17th, starting **today** refund transactions received as *credit* will be linked to the `paymentId` of their original *debit* authorization when referenced by merchants.

## Coming up
