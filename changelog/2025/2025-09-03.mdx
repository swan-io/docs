## New features

üìñ We've added a new [**Preview** section](https://docs.swan.io/preview/) to our API documentation, giving you early access to upcoming and beta features. 
Preview features help you prepare for future releases. Keep in mind the exact implementation may change before official launch.

## Improvements

‚èπÔ∏è You can now [cancel merchant SEPA Direct Debit payments](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/#canceling) using the `cancelMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Check the `availableToCancel` balance to determine if a specific payment can be canceled.

üîç You can verify whether scheduled account funding transactions are eligible for [cancellation](/topics/accounts/funding/#canceling) using the `isCancelable` field.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

üîÑ Starting **October 1st**, we're removing the `paymentId` field from the `initiateSepaDirectDebitMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Instead, retrieve the ID from the `merchantPayment` field, which now returns the Merchant Payment object.
We're also deprecating the `paymentId` field today.

‚öñÔ∏è Starting **October 31st**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be mandatory at onboarding when the `accountCountry` and the account holder's residency address country don't match, due to [CRS regulation](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf) requirements.
For example, Spanish residents opening French accounts will need to provide their tax identification number.
