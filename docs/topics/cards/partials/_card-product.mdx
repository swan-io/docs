<p>Each card product has a <b>different card design</b> and potentially different settings.
You can have several card products within the same project, each with a unique <code>cardProduct</code> > <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>The very first card product created is your default card product. You won't need to include the <code>id</code> for this card product when issuing cards. If you disable the default card product, however, you <b>must include</b> the <code>CardProductId</code> anytime you call a mutation to add cards (<code>addCard</code>, <code>addCards</code>, <code>addCardsWithGroupDelivery</code>, and <code>printPhysicalCard</code>).</p>

<p>All <b>new card products</b> undergo a <b>review</b> before you can add cards with that design.
You can also <b>suspend</b> a card product if you don't want it to be available to your users anymore.</p>
