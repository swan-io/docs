# Belgian IBANs

Issue local Belgian IBANs for your account holders and members, providing enhanced banking experience and regulatory compliance for Belgian users.

## Overview

Belgian IBAN support expands Swan's local IBAN coverage to Belgium, allowing you to offer familiar local banking experiences to Belgian customers. Account holders registered in Belgium will receive Belgian IBANs (with a `BE` prefix) instead of French IBANs.

### Key benefits

- **Expanded market reach**: Serve Belgian customers with local banking infrastructure.
- **Regulatory alignment**: Meet Belgian banking regulations and reporting requirements.
- **Enhanced user trust**: Local IBANs increase customer confidence and reduce payment friction.
- **Local banking integration**: Seamless integration with Belgian banking systems and practices.

## Geographic scope

Belgian IBANs are available for:
- **Account holders** registered in Belgium.
- **Account members** located anywhere globally (standard Swan coverage).
- **Business accounts** for Belgian companies and subsidiaries.

## Integration impact

Belgian IBAN support maintains full compatibility with existing Swan integrations:

- **No breaking changes**: Existing API calls continue to work unchanged.
- **Standard onboarding flow**: Uses existing individual and company onboarding processes.
- **Consistent permissions**: Account membership permissions work identically across all local IBANs.
