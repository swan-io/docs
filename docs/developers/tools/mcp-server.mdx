# MCP server

Swan's MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)) server gives AI assistants intelligent access to Swan's GraphQL API schema through two specialized search tools.

## Why use the MCP server

Swan's GraphQL schema is comprehensive but large, containing over 200,000 characters. This creates challenges when working with AI assistants:

- Most AI models cannot load schemas of this size.
- Large context windows waste tokens processing irrelevant types.
- Finding specific types or fields becomes impractical.
- Response times suffer from unnecessary information processing.

The MCP server solves these problems by providing filtered, context-aware schema access. Instead of loading the entire schema, AI assistants retrieve only the relevant portions needed to answer your questions.

**Benefits**:

- Search by keywords to find relevant types and fields.
- Get detailed type information with configurable depth.
- Receive compact schema snippets (typically under 20KB instead of 200KB+).
- Navigate complex type hierarchies efficiently.

## Available tools

The MCP server provides two tools your AI assistant uses automatically:

### search-graphql-schema

Searches Swan's GraphQL schema using keywords and returns only relevant parts.

**Example queries**:

- "Find all types related to payments"
- "What fields are available for user accounts?"
- "Show me authentication-related types"

### introspect-graphql-type

Gets detailed information about specific GraphQL types, including fields, related types, and dependencies.

**Example queries**:

- "What is the Account type?"
- "How do I create a payment using the GraphQL API?"
- "Show me all fields on the Transaction type"

## Setup

Add this configuration to your AI coding agent's MCP settings.

<Tabs groupId="mcp-config">
<TabItem value="cursor" label="Cursor">

Add to your Cursor MCP configuration file:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swan-graphql": {
      "url": "https://mcp.swan.io/graphql/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor after saving the configuration.

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swan-graphql": {
      "url": "https://mcp.swan.io/graphql/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving the configuration.

## Use cases

Connect AI coding assistants like Cursor to the MCP server for accurate help understanding Swan's API and generating complex GraphQL queries for your integration.

**Example**: Ask your AI assistant "How do I create a SEPA Credit Transfer?" and it will search the schema, find the relevant mutation, and generate a complete query with all required fields.

## How it works

When you ask your AI assistant a question about Swan's API:

1. The AI assistant identifies which MCP tool to use based on your question.
2. The tool searches Swan's schema for relevant information.
3. The MCP server returns only the schema portions needed to answer your question.
4. Your AI assistant uses this information to provide accurate, schema-based responses.

This approach keeps context windows manageable while ensuring accurate, up-to-date API information.
