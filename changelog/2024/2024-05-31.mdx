### Improvements

📱 [Deactivate users](/topics/users/overview/guide-deactivate/) who aren't using Swan anymore. This way, their phone number can be reused for a different user.

🌐 In **about 2 weeks**, you'll be able to choose and update the preferred language for account memberships, which is used for the invitation email and when ordering and using cards.

- By default, the new `AccountMembership.language` inherits the `Account.language` chosen during onboarding.
- The available languages are: Dutch `nl`, English `en`, French `fr`, German `de`, Italian `it`, Portuguese `pt`, and Spanish `es`.
- Finnish `fi` won't be supported for the account membership language yet.
- If you're subscribed to the `AccountMembership.Updated` webhook, you'll receive a webhook notification when `AccountMembership.language` is live.
- If you've already used the `updateAccountMembership` mutation to choose the language for an account membership, it won't change with this update.
