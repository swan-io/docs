# French checks for merchants

:::caution beta
Accepting payments with French checks is in private beta.
:::

Merchants can accept payments using French checks if the debtor's bank is located in France.

## About French checks for merchants {#about}

While paper checks are not the most convenient or secure payment method, they are still a valid way to exchange money.
Some users prefer checks, and merchants can accept French checks if they activate this payment method for accepting payments.

There isn't a Swan user interface for accepting checks.
This feature is only available using the API.

## Required API fields {#fields}

When declaring checks with the API, there are five mandatory API fields:

1. `amount`: monetary amount of the check (can't exceed 10 000€).
1. `currency`: `EUR` (only euros are supported).
1. `CMC7` (Caractères Magnétiques Codés à 7 bâtonnets): 31-digit code composed of 3 series of numbers.
   - Series 1: check number; 7 digits
   - Series 2: interbank codes; 12 digits
   - Series 3: account number; 12 digits
1. `rlmcKey` (Recomposition de la Ligne Magnétique du Chèque): 2-digit code surrounded by chevrons `< >` or parentheses `( )` calculated based on the CMC7.
1. `merchantProfileId`: your developers should enter the merchant's profile ID number.

On the **back of the check**, the merchant must write their Swan account number as well as provide their signature.

| Payment method | Rolling reserve | Default amount             |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| French checks  | ✓ **Yes**       | 100% over 10 business days |

## Settlement date and booked time {#settlement}

Checks are booked 2-3 business days after they arrive at the check processing center.

## FNCI & verifying checks {#fnci}

The FNCI stands for _Le fichier national des chèques irréguliers_, meaning the National Irregular Check Register.
It's a database of stolen and opposed checks made available to remitters by the _Banque de France_, helping you and your users **reduce the risk** of cashing fraudulent checks.

When your merchants accept check payments with Swan, Swan **verifies the check's regularity** with the _Banque de France_.
You **receive the result** of a check's verification **with the API**, and your merchants see the result if you're using Swan's Web Banking interface.
If you're not using Web Banking, consider **integrating the FNCI result** in your product.

### FNCI results {#fnci-results}

Results are provided through the API and on Swan's Web Banking interface.
With the results, you receive the **name of the bank that issued the check** along with two key pieces of information: the **color code** and the **Check Payment Control (CPT)**.

      Irregular, meaning there's something wrong with the check. For example,
      the account might be closed, the account holder might not be allowed to
      write checks, or the check might have been reported as lost or stolen.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Holder establishment</td>
    <td>The name of the bank that issued the check.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

:::caution Confirm holder establishment
If the bank name is different from the holder establishment provided in the FNCI result, it may indicate fraud, even if the color code is green.

## R-transactions {#r-transactions}

### Rejected {#rejected}

Checks can be rejected by Swan's check provider and **returned to the merchant by mail**.
They'll receive helpful information about why the check has been rejected, and then they can **fix and resend the rejected checks**.

**Before resending the rejected check**, the merchant should create a new `checkIn` transaction.
If they send the check without creating the new `checkIn` transaction, the check **remains rejected** and will be returned to the merchant again.

Additionally, all checks not sent to Swan's check provider within 30 days of being declared will be automatically `Rejected`.

A check transaction can be rejected for the following reasons:

| Rejection reason                | Explanation                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AmountMismatch`                | Amount on the check and amount declared through the API don't match                                                                               |
| `BeneficiaryMissingOrIncorrect` | Merchant's name is missing or incorrect                                                                                                           |
| `CheckReceivedLate`             | Check was received by Swan's check provider more than 30 days after the check was declared, or if Swan's check provider received a canceled check |
| `DateMissing`                   | There's no date on the check                                                                                                                      |
| `DateInvalid`                   | Date on the check is in the future or isn't valid                                                                                                 |
| `DebtorNameMissing`             | Debtor's name (merchant's customer) must appear on the check                                                                                      |
| `EndorsementMissing`            | Merchant didn't sign the back of the check or provide their Swan account number                                                                   |
| `InvalidOrMissingAmount`        | No amount is written on the check, the format shows an invalid amount, or the amount is shared in the wrong format (numbers instead of letters)   |
| `SignatureMissing`              | Signature is missing, or there was a problem with the signature                                                                                   |

### Returned {#returned}

Checks can be returned up to 11 business days after the transaction is `Booked`, and this window can be extended to 90 calendar days based on the reason for return.

A check transaction might be returned for the following reasons (this list is not exhaustive):

- Insufficient funds
- Account closed
- Loss or theft

By the time a check is returned, the merchant's account has already be credited.
Therefore, when Swan is notified that a `Booked` check has gone unpaid, a `checkInReturn` transaction is created automatically.

### Canceled {#canceled}

Creditors can cancel a received check with the `Upcoming` status _unless_ the check processing center already received the check.
In this case of a canceled check, the status switches automatically to `Canceled`.
This transaction won't impact the account's available balance.
