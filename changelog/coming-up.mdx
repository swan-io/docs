  <summary>⚠️ **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

    📄 On **November 12th**:
    - The [`verificationFlow`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding-info/#onboardinginfoverificationflowverificationflow---) field will be removed from the [`OnboardingInfo` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding-info/). This field is deprecated and no longer serves any purpose.
    - The [`redirectUrl` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding#onboardingredirecturlstring---) will be removed from both the [`Onboarding`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding) and [`OnboardingInfo`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding-info) objects. It has been deprecated for two years and replaced by the [`oauthRedirectParameters` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/oauth-redirect-parameters/).
    - The [`title` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/individual-ultimate-beneficial-owner#individualultimatebeneficialownertitletitleenum-) will be removed from the [Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/individual-ultimate-beneficial-owner/). It has been deprecated and replaced by the [`gender` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/individual-ultimate-beneficial-owner#individualultimatebeneficialownergendergender-).
    - The [`onboardingState` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding-info/#onboardinginfoonboardingstateonboardingstate-) will be removed from the [`OnboardingInfo` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding-info/). This field is deprecated and no longer serves any purpose.

    📝 Starting **November 12th**, the `onboarding(id: ID!)` query may return `null` when no onboarding exists for the given ID, instead of always returning an `Onboarding` object.

    🧹 On **December 1st**, the deprecated `totalCapitalDepositAmount` field will be removed from the [`CreateCapitalDepositCaseInput` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/create-capital-deposit-case-input/). The total is now computed automatically from shareholder contribution amounts. It remains available in responses.

    🧹 On **December 1st**, the deprecated `companyInfoBySiren` query will be removed. Company information retrieval is now integrated directly into the onboarding creation and update flows, eliminating the need for separate queries.

    ⚠️ Starting **January 23rd, 2026**, the following fields will be removed from the [`accountStatement`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/account-statement/) and [`accountStatements`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/account-statements/) queries and from the [`generateAccountStatement` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/generate-account-statement/) response:

    - `fees` is replaced by `feeCredits` and `feeDebits`.
    - `status` is replaced by the `statusInfo` object.
    - The statement download `url`, previously in the `type` object, is now only in `statusInfo`.

    🧹 On **February 5th, 2026**, the deprecated `status` field will be removed from the [`CapitalDepositCase` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/capital-deposit-case/). Migrate to the `statusInfo` field, which was introduced on October 23rd and provides more granular status updates including `WaitingForInitialRequirements`, `PendingInternalReview`, and `WaitingForAdditionalInformation`.
