## Improvements

🔍 The [`CapitalDepositCase` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/capital-deposit-case/) now includes a `statusInfo` field with granular status tracking. This replaces the generic `WaitingForRequirements` status with three clear stages:

- **`WaitingForInitialRequirements`**: Shareholder verification, fund transfers, document uploads, and company onboarding are pending.
- **`PendingInternalReview`**: Swan is reviewing submitted information and documents.
- **`WaitingForAdditionalInformation`**: Swan has requested corrections or additional details.

The existing `status` field remains available but is deprecated. This is not a breaking change, you can adopt `statusInfo` at your own pace. The Dashboard continues to display the `status` label.

💰 The [`updateCapitalDepositShareholderAmount` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/update-capital-deposit-shareholder-amount/) lets you correct shareholder deposit amounts. Requirements:

- Capital deposit case status is `WaitingForInitialRequirements`, `PendingInternalReview`, or `WaitingForAdditionalInformation`. Also supports the deprecated `WaitingForRequirements` status.
- Shareholder status is `PendingOnboarding`, `WaitingForVerification`, or `WaitingForTransfer`.

Updating an amount automatically recalculates the total capital deposit.

🏬 The [`updateCapitalDepositCompany` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/update-capital-deposit-company/) lets you correct the company name and postal address linked to a capital deposit. Requirements:

- Capital deposit case status is `WaitingForInitialRequirements`, `PendingInternalReview`, or `WaitingForAdditionalInformation`. Also supports the deprecated `WaitingForRequirements` status.
- Company onboarding is `Finalized`.

Updates sync automatically across both the capital deposit case and the associated account holder.

📄 Account statements now include precise status tracking and refined field structure:

- **New `Voided` status**: Marks incorrect statements. When voided, a corrected version regenerates automatically with identical characteristics (format, language, opening and closing dates). The `statusInfo` object reflects this status and will replace the `status` field (see upcoming breaking changes).
- **Refined fee fields**: The `fees` field is now split into `feeCredits` (sum of credit fee transactions) and `feeDebits` (sum of debit fee transactions).
- **Clearer format naming**: The `type` field is now `format`.
- **New webhook**: [`AccountStatement.Voided`](/developers/using-api/webhooks#events-accounts) triggers when a statement is marked as `Voided`.
