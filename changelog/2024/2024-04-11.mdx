### Improvements

📃 It's now possible to simulate a supporting document request in Sandbox.

📅 We've improved the account holder queries with `verificationStatusInfo`, allowing you to get the exact date when a verification status was updated.

🔚 Shareholder accounts are now set to `Closing` upon completion of the capital deposit case.
First, we will use `CloseAccountReasonType` = `ComplianceReason`.
In **4 weeks**, we will use the new value `CapitalDepositReason`.

### Breaking changes

⚠️ The Ultimate Beneficial Owner's (UBO) residency country is now mandatory in our **no-code onboarding form**.

### Upcoming breaking changes

🙅🏾 In 4 weeks, the status `Canceled` will be added to `CapitalDepositCase` and `Shareholder`, and the status `Refused` will be added to `CapitalDepositCase`.
While the `Refused` state will be implemented later, we include the value now to mitigate future impact.
