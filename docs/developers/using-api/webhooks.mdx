## Overview {#overview}

You're aware of events you request or that your user's request directly from you.
Consider the [basic API flow](../index.mdx#overview) for reference.
However, **not all events are under your control**; some events are triggered by external parties.
When external events occur, resources are updated in Swan, but you aren't notified by default.

If you **configure webhooks for these external events**, Swan initiates a request on your endpoint and you receive a webhook notification.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant P as Partner (you)
participant S as Swan
participant E as External event
    E -->> S: Updates an API resource
    S ->> P: Sends request to your configured endpoints
    par        
        P ->> S: Returns 200 OK HTTP
        P ->> S: Calls query for resource
    end
    S ->> P: Returns resource
```

### Response time {#overview-response}

Webhooks operate with a near-real-time efficiency, typically delivering responses **within seconds** of the event.

It's worth clarifying that webhooks don't actively *respond* but autonomously send information to your system, potentially introducing delays of up to 10 minutes after the actual action occurs.

### Security {#overview-security}

Webhooks aren't the most secure communication method, and banking data can be sensitive.
Therefore, **Swan never uses webhooks to send sensitive information** that requires authentication to view.

If an event involves sensitive information, the webhook only includes a notification that an event occurred.
You need to use your Dashboard or the API to actually review the information.

:::note Swan's webhook IP addresses
If you have security restrictions in your infrastructure, you might need to add the following IPs to your allowlist for both Sandbox and Live environments.

- 52.210.172.90
- 52.51.125.72
- 54.194.47.212
:::

### Automatic retry {#overview-retry}

If we encounter an error during a webhook request, we'll retry every **30 seconds** up to **7 times**.

If all retries fail, you can retry it manually by selecting **Retry** from your **Dashboard** > **Developers** > **Webhooks**.
You can also trigger the webhook manually at any time.

## Event handling {#event-handling}

Handling webhooks is important to make sure your integration's business logic works as expected.

### Delivery method {#event-handling-delivery}

Swan webhooks are designed following the `at-least once` delivery method.
Taking transactions as an example, the `at-least once` delivery means that for the same `eventId`, you might receive more than one notification.

Swan chose `at-least once` delivery deliberately over the `at-most once` delivery; it's better you receive the information multiple times instead of not at all, which can occur with `at-most once` in case of technical error.

### Idempotent process {#event-handling-idempotent}

Due to `at-least once` delivery, a webhook endpoint might receive the same event notification multiple times.
Therefore, Swan strongly suggests **making your event processing idempotent**, essentially making sure your response to webhook notifications can be repeated multiple times without producing different outcomes.

For example, you might log the events you've processed, and then not process events that are already logged.

### Event order {#event-handling-order}

Webhook notifications aren't always delivered in the order the events occur.
If you want to receive webhooks in a specific order, you'll need to implement logic on your end.

For example, consider the regular card payment flow, which is always **Authorization** to **Debit** to **Released**.
The flow generates the following webhook events:

- Authorization: `Transaction.Pending`
- Debit: `Transaction.Booked`
- Released: `Transaction.Released`

You'll receive the `Transaction.Pending` as soon as the authorization is created.

However, you can receive `Transaction.Booked` and `Transaction.Released` webhooks in any order, even though the flow is always Debit, then Released.

    A(<i>Authorization</i><br/>Transaction.Pending) --> P((Possibilities))
    P --> B(<i>Debit</i><br/>Transaction.Booked) --> D(<i>Released</i><br/>Transaction.Released)
