# Add a payment mandate

Add SEPA Direct Debit received payment mandates with the API.

[From old doc](https://docs.swan.io/concept/payment/direct-debit#creation-of-a-received-sepa-direct-debit-mandate)

Received SEPA direct debit mandates can be created in two different ways:

1. Automatically by Swan from a received SEPA direct debit instruction:
    - SEPA Direct Debit Core: the received SEPA direct debit mandate is deemed valid by default and is created by Swan under the SepaDirectDebitCore scheme with the Enabled status
    - SEPA Direct Debit B2B: the received SEPA direct debit mandate needs to be consented to by an accountMembership with the CanInitiatePayments rights on the account being debited. It is created by Swan under the SepaDirectDebitB2b scheme with the ConsentInitiationPending status and switched to Enabled status once consent has been given using the enableReceivedDirectDebitMandate mutation
1. SEPA Direct Debit B2B only: by any accountMembership with the CanInitiatePayments rights on the account to which the received SEPA Direct Debit B2B mandate needs to be associated with, using the addReceivedSepaDirectDebitB2bMandate mutation with consent.
