# Account holders

import AccountHolderDefinition from '../../definitions/_account-holder.mdx';

***

**Account holder** *<AccountHolderDefinition />*

***

Account holders can be **individuals** or **companies** (considered *legal entities*), and account holders can have as many Swan accounts as they need.
In order for funds to be stored in a Swan account, they must be associated with an account holder.

As a result of the onboarding process, **users become account holders**.

## Verifying account holders {#verifying-account-holders}

As a Partner and project owner, you choose who can have Swan accounts within your project.

However, regulations require **Swan to verify all of your account holders**, and to keep track of them for the lifetime of the account.
Therefore, Swan verifies each user before the account holder and account objects are created in your Swan project.
This verification is often referred to as **Know Your Customer (KYC)** or **Know Your Business (KYB)**.

:::note Verification responsibility
One benefit of working with Swan is that Swan is responsible for this process.
However, if it is vital that you perform KYC and KYB processes yourself, please send an email to support@swan.io with a detailed explanation.

### One account holder, multiple accounts {#verifying-account-holders-multi-account}

For company accounts, you can open multiple accounts for the same account holder.
In this case, Swan only needs to perform identity verification (Know Your Business [KYB] verification) if a KYB has not been performed within the last three months.

Follow the guide to [add additional accounts](./guide-add-additional-account.mdx) for an existing account holder.

## Verification process {#verification-process}

The verification process for a new account holder is thorough, and Swan provides a streamlined process through which each account holder proves they're who they claim to be.

Account holders can access their account immediately after creation.
However, while the verification is in progress, there are limitations on the account.
IBANs might be issued before limitations are removed from the account.
Learn more in [IBAN issuing](https://docs.swan.io/concept/iban/iban-issuing).

### Components {#verification-process-components}

1. **Onboarding**: Process is finalized for either an [**individual**](../individual/index.mdx) or a [**company**](../company/index.mdx), which creates an *account holder*, an *account*, and a *user*.
1. **Identity verification**: Newly-created [**individual**](../individual/index.mdx#id-verification-recommendations) or [**company**](../company/index.mdx#id-verification-recommendations) account holder completes identity verification with an ID document and a picture or video.
1. **Document collection**: Swan collects [**required documents**](../documents/index.mdx).
1. **Review**: Swan reviews onboarding, identity verification, and collected documents.

After Swan **validates the review**, the account holder is verified and the restrictions on their account are lifted, meaning they're no longer limited to 150â‚¬ in outgoing payments.
Their account will also receive its primary IBAN.

### Sequence diagram {#verification-process-diagram}

This diagram **details a common flow** of how Swan, the account holder, and you interact during verification.
Your integration might flow differently.
