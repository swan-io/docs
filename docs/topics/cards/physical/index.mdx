**Physical cards** *<PhysicalCardsDefinition />*

***

You can order a physical card for each virtual card.
Swan physical cards are typical plastic cards that can be used for swipe, chip and PIN, contactless, and online transactions.
Your [design](../design/index.mdx) will be printed on all physical cards.

## Card numbers {#number}

Each physical card has a unique card number, different even from the virtual card added before the physical card was printed.

Swan makes the physical card's number, CVC, expiry date, and the PIN available in Web Banking.
The **card number**, **CVC**, and **PIN** are considered sensitive data and must be **masked by default**.
The cardholder must complete a **consent request** before the numbers can be unmasked.

### PIN {#pin}

Physical cards have a **four-digit PIN**, or personal identification number.
PINs are assigned when the card is printed and **can't be changed**.

The PIN for each physical card is available to the cardholder on Swan's Web Banking interface.
PINs aren't available on your Dashboard because only the cardholder should have easy access to the PIN for their card.

If a cardholder **forgets their PIN**, they can view it on your interface.
If needed, you can use the `ViewPhysicalCardPin` mutation to view the numbers yourself, which requires a user access token associated with the cardholder.
Note that if three incorrect attempts are made to enter the PIN, the card is automatically `Suspended`.

:::caution
If a cardholder shares their PIN, Swan can't take responsibility for fraud associated with that card.
:::

### Incorrect PIN attempts {#pin-incorrect-attempts}

If the cardholder enters their PIN incorrectly **three times**, the physical card will be blocked (status: suspended) and no payments with the physical can be made online or in person.

Note that a physical card blocked for three incorrect PIN attempts will have the reason `IncorrectPinCodeAttemptsExceeded` (on the `PhysicalCardSuspendedStatusInfo`).
You'll have to wait 24 hours before being able to [unblock the physical card](./guide-block-unblock.mdx).

You can continue to use both virtual and digital cards.

## Printing and shipping hubs {#hubs}

Delivery time for physical cards depends on the type of card material you select and your cardholders' location.
It typically takes **2-5 business days** for cards to be delivered.
Please note that the delivery times listed here are estimates and aren't contractual.

Swan has **two printing hubs**: one in France and the other in Spain.
**France is Swan's default hub**.
To **choose the Spain hub**, tell your Technical Account Manager and they'll configure it.

:::info Two card products
The printing hub is defined in the [card product ID](../index.mdx#card-product).
If you'd like to ship cards out of both hubs, you need two card products: one with France as the hub, and the other with Spain.
:::

If your cardholder reports not receiving their physical card, please refer them to the [Swan Support Center](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/5503032519837).

| `ToActivate` | Cardholder received the physical card, but needs to activate it by performing a first transaction and entering the PIN; you can also activate the card with the `activatePhysicalCard` mutation<br/><br/>**Next steps**:<ul><li>If the cardholder performs the transaction successfully, or you activate the card with the API, the status moves to `ToActivate`</li><li>If the cardholder makes **three incorrect attempts** to enter their PIN, the status moves to `Suspended`</li></ul> |
