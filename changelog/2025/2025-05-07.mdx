## New features

📥 You can now [export accounts data](/topics/accounts/overview/guide-export) in .csv format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the exportAccountData mutation.

## Improvements

🪪 [`Auto`-identification](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user/#url-parameters-optional) is now smoother. To automatically skip the identification process for eligible users on projects configured to bypass it, add the `accountMembershipId` to the authorization URL when inviting account members. 

🤏 To help protect you and the merchant from fraud, merchant payments may now be subject to a `paymentAmountLimit`. 
This applies to each individual payment when it’s initiated. Based on risk signals, Swan's Risk team may set this [limit](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/webhooks/#events-funding) when reviewing the merchant payment method, or at a later stage. 
The limit is available in the `merchantPaymentMethod` type in the API for [Card](/topics/merchants/online/cards/#payment-limit), [SEPA Direct Debit](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/#payment-limit) Core and B2B, and [French checks](/topics/merchants/online/checks/#payment-limit). 
Setting a limit will trigger a `MerchantPaymentMethod.Updated` webhook.

## Update

🧾 Starting May 1st, invoices will be issued through our new billing provider, Lago.
The format will change, but the content will remain the same.
