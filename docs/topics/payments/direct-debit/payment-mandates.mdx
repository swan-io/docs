# Payment mandates

intro

## Canceling payment mandates

Payment mandates are canceled by Swan automatically after their expiry date.

Direct debit payment mandates are canceled 36 months after being created 

(ex: card expiry for a card funding source, or 36 months following the payment mandate creation for direct debit funding sources in case there has been no transaction) or for example when a fraud is detected by Swan.
