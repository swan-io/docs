## Updates

🪪 Starting **August 7th**, we'll [recommend](/topics/users/identifications/#processes-recommendations) `QES` as the identification method for German accounts, replacing the current `Expert` level. If you use `Auto`, our smart routing system, no action is needed. This change will apply automatically.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

🔐 Starting **July 10th**, failed consent attempts will trigger the `Consent.Failed` webhook. 
Previously, failed consents triggered `Consent.Granted`, due to a bug. The new webhook is already available in your Dashboard.

✉️ Starting **July 21st**, the `shippingProvider` field in `PhysicalCardToActivateStatusInfo` and `PhysicalCardRenewedStatusInfo` will be migrated from a `String` to an `ENUM`. 
On the same day, the [shipping provider](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/shipping-provider/) values `La Poste` and `CORREOS` will be removed.
