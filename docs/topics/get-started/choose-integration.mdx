# Choose your integration

Swan is an **API-first financial platform**.

Swan offers a Web Banking **user interface** (often referred to as **no-code**) so you can launch quickly with less developer involvement.

To find a balance between the flexibility of the Swan API and the ready-made user interface, consider using **Swan Banking Frontend**, an open source project that provides the building blocks for a customized web banking app.

Regardless of which configuration you choose, you'll also use the **Dashboard**.

## Full-API integration {#full-api}

Swan is API-first.
To take full advantage of all Swan has to offer and completely customize your user experience, choose a comprehensive, **full-API integration**.

In tandem with your API integration, you can use the Swan Banking Frontend to create a web banking app for your users.
This open source project provides the components for a fully customizable frontend.

When your full-API integration is ready to go live, follow the guide to [activate your project](../projects/guide-activate.mdx).
Swan reviews all integrations before going live to ensure success.

## No-code user interface {#user-interface}

Swan's user interface, often referred to as no-code, is the quickest way to get started with Swan and provides **ready-made web banking** for your users.

When you choose the no-code interface, you'll use your Dashboard to test everything.
Toggle between Sandbox and Live to test new functionalities.
If you're in Sandbox, everything is fake and nothing carries over to Live.

When your integration with Swan's user interface is ready to go live, follow the guide to [activate your project](../projects/guide-activate.mdx).
Swan reviews all integrations before going live to ensure success.

Even with Swan ready-made user interface, there are a few API mutations you'll need to use; your Technical Account Manager is here to help.
Additionally, you can always evolve from the ready-made user interface to API customizationâ€”Swan is only an email away.

:::caution Customization
Customization is limited with the no-code interface: upload a logo and choose a single accent color.
To meet web accessibility guidelines, please confirm that your accent color passes at least WCAG AA checks with both white `#ffffff` and black `#000000`.

## Open source Swan Banking Frontend {#open-source}

If you like the convenience of Swan's ready-made web banking app but are too limited by the customization restraints, the **Swan Banking Frontend** is for you.

Use Swan's [open source project](https://github.com/swan-io/swan-partner-frontend) to provide a web banking app that matches your company's style guidelines, plus all user onboarding flows.
This project contains the same code used by Swan internally for the ready-made user interface.

:::tip Open source documentation
Use the [**Swan Banking Frontend documentation**](https://swan-io.github.io/swan-partner-frontend/) to set up your instance, customize your designs, and understand the specifications.

The open source project might be interesting to you if:

- You need to **bootstrap** your Swan UI quickly.
- You need to **customize** your user experience, whether with fonts and colors or by eliminating optional components.
- You'd like to **learn** from Swan's reference implementation.
