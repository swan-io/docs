## Print a physical card {#print-one}

Permitted users can order their own cards using Swan's Web Banking interface.

When they order a card, print it for them by calling the `printPhysicalCard` mutation which returns a consent.
When you do this, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token belonging to a member with the `canManageCards` permission.
Then a `consentUrl` is returned which invites the user to start Strong Customer Authentication with Swan.

Delivery details are available in the `PhysicalCardToActivateStatus` object, with the estimated date of delivery in the `estimatedDeliveryDatefield`.
The carrier and tracking number are available in the `shippingProvider` and `trackingNumber`.
The card's status will be `ToActivate` until the card is activated.

Your users will receive their cards as quickly as possible.
Refer to Swan's [card delivery times](./index.mdx#hubs) for more information.

## Print a physical card when adding a virtual card {#print-with-virtual}

Call the `addCards` mutation.
To add the physical card at the same time you add the virtual card, use the `physicalCard` field in the `addCards` mutation and enter a delivery address.

## Print physical cards with an additional line {#print-additional-line}

Add `physicalCardCustomOptions` > `additionalPrintedLine` to the object that corresponds to your chosen mutation.

| Mutation | Object |
|---|---|
| `addCards` | Add `physicalCardCustomOptions` > `additionalPrintedLine` to the `physicalCard` object |
| `addCardsWithGroupDelivery` | Add `physicalCardCustomOptions` > `additionalPrintedLine` to the `cards` object |
| `printPhysicalCard` | Add `physicalCardCustomOptions` > `additionalPrintedLine` to the `input` |

## Print multiple physical cards with group delivery {#print-group}

To ship a group of cards together to the same address, call the `addCardsWithGroupDelivery` mutation.
It works just like `addCards` (explained in the [guide to add virtual cards](../virtual/guide-add.mdx#add-multiple)), except all the cards are sent together in one package.
This method is cost-effective and eco-friendly.
