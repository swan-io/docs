title: Insurance on cards
---

Swan now offers insurance packages that can be added to payment cards, providing extra protection for cardholders. Partners can choose to create cards with embedded insurance or without it.

There are three standard insurance packages available:

- **Basic**
- **Essential**
- **Premium**

Once an insurance package is assigned to a card product, all new cards created under that product will automatically include the chosen insurance by default.
