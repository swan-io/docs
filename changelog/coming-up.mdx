  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

‚ö†Ô∏è Starting **October 1st**, we're removing the `paymentId` field from the `initiateSepaDirectDebitMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Instead, retrieve the ID from the `merchantPayment` field, which now returns the Merchant Payment object.

üìñ Starting **October 9th**, the new **[Verification of Payee](/preview/vop/verification-of-payee/)** regulation takes effect.

üì° Starting **October 9th**, bulk SEPA Credit Transfers from individual account holders will be rejected if [verification tokens](/preview/vop/guide-verify-beneficiary/#step-3) aren't included in the payment initiation. You must either implement the `verifyBeneficiary` mutation (recommended) or restrict bulk credit transfer access to company accounts only. This change applies to both Live and Sandbox environments.

üõë Starting **October 9th**, the `initiateCreditTransfers` mutation will return a new [rejection reason](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/beneficiary-verification-token-already-consumed-rejection/) if the `BeneficiaryVerificationToken` was previously used in another credit transfer initiation. 

üí≥ On **October 16th**, the `CardUrl` field will be removed. This field is being deprecated. Use `cardMaskedNumber`, `expiryDate`, and `cardDesignUrl` instead.

üõí On **October 16th**, the following [merchant profiles and merchant payment methods](/topics/merchants/) breaking changes will take effect:

- A new `WaitingForInformation` status and `verificationRequirements` list will be available for merchant profiles and merchant payment methods to communicate missing information. These requirements must be provided at the merchant profile level using the `requestMerchantProfile` and `requestMerchantProfileUpdate` mutations. 
- A new `supportingDocumentCollections` field will also be available at the merchant profile level for providing required documents.
- The fields `invoiceExample`, `expectedMonthlyPaymentVolume`, `merchantWebsite`, `socialNetwork`, `supportWebsite`, `termsAndConditions` will be **removed** from the API.
- `rejectReasons` will be removed for card payment methods.
- `rejectionReasons` for `Rejected` merchant profiles and Merchant Payment Methods will become mandatory in the Testing APIs `simulateMerchantProfileRequestOutcome` and `simulateMerchantPaymentMethodRequestOutcome`.
- Dynamic rolling reserve changes and maximum payment amount limits will be introduced at the merchant payment method level to mitigate risk. Subscribe to the `MerchantPaymentMethod.Created` and `MerchantPaymentMethod.Updated` webhooks for these updates.

üí∏ Effective **October 19th**, we're introducing the following updates to the `initiateCreditTransfers` endpoint to improve its usability and clarity:

- The `save` parameter will default to `false`.
- The `mode` parameter will be a **required** field. The default value is set to `Regular`.
- The `isMyOwnIban` and `beneficiaryId` input fields will be **removed**.
- The API will return a `ValidationRejection` error instead of `ForbiddenRejection` when an input contains **invalid** data.

‚úîÔ∏è Starting **October 31st**, in the context of the Verification of Payee regulation, the `beneficiaryVerification` query will be deprecated. Use `verifyBeneficiary` instead to ensure uninterrupted service.

‚ö†Ô∏è Starting **October 31**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be a mandatory field at onboarding when an account holder's residency country doesn't match the `accountCountry`. This is to comply with [CRS (Common Reporting Standard) regulations](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf).

üë• Starting **December 31st**, the `bookedBalanceAfter` field will be removed from the transaction query. Please use the `balanceAfter.amount` on `BookedTransactionStatusInfo`.
