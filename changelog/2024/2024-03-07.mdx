### New features

✅ Before initiating a credit transfer to a Swan account from a Dutch financial institution, payers can now [check the account holder's name and account status](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/#beneficiary-verification).
This will remove current friction when receiving SEPA Credit Transfers from the Netherlands.

### Upcoming breaking changes

💥 In **4 weeks**, the Ultimate Beneficial Owner's residency country becomes mandatory in our no-code onboarding form.
In **4 months**, our API will enforce this change as well.
