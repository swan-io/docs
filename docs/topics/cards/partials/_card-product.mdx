<p>A card product is a collection of design information and configuration settings for the cards you ultimately offer your users.
You can have several card products within the same project, each with a unique <code>cardProduct.id</code>.</p>

<p>
  Each card product can have a <b>different card design</b> and{" "}
  <b>different settings</b>. Alternatively, card products might have{" "}
  <b>common</b> designs and settings, depending on your needs. For example, you
  might choose to offer a single design, but have several card products with
  different settings based on the intended users.
</p>

<p>
  The very first card product created is your default card product. You won't
  need to include the <code>id</code> for this card product when issuing cards.
  If you disable the default card product, however, you <b>must include</b> the{" "}
  <code>CardProductId</code> anytime you call a mutation to add cards (
  <code>addCard</code>, <code>addCards</code>,{" "}
  <code>addCardsWithGroupDelivery</code>, and <code>printPhysicalCard</code>).
</p>

<p>All <b>new card products</b> undergo a <b>review</b> before you can add cards with that design.
You can also <b>suspend</b> a card product if you don't want it to be available to your users anymore.</p>
