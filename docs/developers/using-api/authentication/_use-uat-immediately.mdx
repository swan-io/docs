:::caution Verify which user is logged in
{props.overview}, **use it immediately** to **verify which user is logged in**.

Adding a `phoneNumber` to the OAuth 2.0 URL in step 2.1 **isn't sufficient** to know which user is logged in.
Sometimes, a phone number might have been used by a [deactivated user](../../../topics/users/index.mdx#deactivate) before being used for a new user.
Additionally, your user might have replaced the number you provided with a different number, or gone through the process to [update their phone number](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/16332148291741-Updating-your-phone-number) with Swan.

It's impossible to detect these changes when getting a user access token, so it's **crucial to verify** that the user associated with the token is the logged-in user.
