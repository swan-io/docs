# Accepting online payments

Merchants can accept online payments with Swan.

:::info Merchant profile
Before accepting online payments, each merchant needs a [merchant profile](../index.mdx#profiles).
:::

## Online payment methods {#methods-online}

import OnlinePaymentMethods from '../partials/_online-list.mdx';

<OnlinePaymentMethods />

## Payment links {#links}

Payment links redirect customers to a Swan-hosted payment page where a customer can choose from the merchant's eligible enabled payment methods.
These optimized payment pages are customizable with the merchant's name, logo, and accent color.

Your merchants can create links to share with their customers by email or text message.
They could also include a QR code on an invoice, scannable by the customer with their mobile device.
