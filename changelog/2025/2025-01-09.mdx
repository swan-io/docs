## New feature

🔔 Activate [text message notifications](/topics/projects/#notifications) about rejected card payments from your **Dashboard** > **Settings** > **Notifications**, delivered in the [account membership language](/topics/accounts/memberships/#language).
Stay tuned to the changelog for upcoming notifications.

## Improvements

📄 We added a [list of rejection reasons for `Refused` supporting documents](/topics/accounts/documents/#refused) for onboarding, transactions, and account holder verifications, providing more visibility about why a document wasn't validated.

📊 **Reorder and lock** **columns on your Dashboard** to prioritize your most important data. Use the *Columns* dropdown, included on every page, to choose your customizations.

🚫 To keep Swan secure, we implemented [**new limits on GraphQL operations**](https://docs.swan.io/developers/#operation-limits) in the **Sandbox**.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

✍️ On **February 7th**, we're removing the `addMerchantProfile` mutation to keep our API consistent.
Instead, call the [`requestMerchantProfile` mutation](/topics/merchants/profiles/guide-request).
We're also deprecating the `addMerchantProfile` mutation today.

🔗 On **April 1st**, we're removing the [deprecated field `Onboarding.redirectUrl`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding/#onboardingredirecturlstring---) from all onboarding mutations.
Instead, use the `OAuthRedirectParameters.redirectUrl` field, also in the [onboarding object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding#onboardingoauthredirectparametersoauthredirectparameters-).
