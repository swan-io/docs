# Activate physical cards

Activate physical cards by either:

1. Entering the PIN when making your first payment, or
1. Calling the `activatePhysicalCard` mutation which returns a consent. You'll need the identifier on the back of the physical card to call this mutation.

When you use the API, make sure you are authenticated with a user access token belonging to the card holder.
Then a `consentUrl` is returned which invites the user to start Strong Customer Authentication with Swan.
