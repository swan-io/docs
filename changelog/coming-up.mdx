  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>
  <div>
‚ö†Ô∏è Effective from **March 10th**, consent notification API requests to your endpoint time out after 2 seconds instead of 3, in order to comply with 3-D Secure (3DS) requirements.

üë• Starting on **March 20th**, account memberships are only returned in the `accountMembership`, `accountMemberships`, and `account.Memberships` queries if you have the `canManageAccountMembership` permission.
Previously, we returned your own account membership.

üîó On **April 1st**, we're removing the [deprecated field `Onboarding.redirectUrl`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding/#onboardingredirecturlstring---) from all onboarding mutations.
Instead, use the `OAuthRedirectParameters.redirectUrl` field, also in the [onboarding object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/onboarding#onboardingoauthredirectparametersoauthredirectparameters-).

‚úç Starting on **April 1st**, the [`registrationNumber` field](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/onboard-company-account-holder-input/#onboardcompanyaccountholderinputregistrationnumberstring-) becomes mandatory for company onboardings, regardless of country.
This applies to all [onboardings](https://docs.swan.io/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs-company-account-holder) where `companyType` is set to `Company`, and where `companyType` is set to `SelfEmployed` and the account country is `France`.
Additionally, the `isRegistered` parameter will be set to `true` automatically for these onboardings.
Please note that this update doesn't impact capital deposits.
