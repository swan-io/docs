description: How to configure and manage card insurance packages at the card product level
---

You can assign one of the [three standard insurance packages](https://www.notion.so/Draft-Card-insurance-overview-22ba3427555a8086ae26eb28d91e0d62?pvs=21) at the card product level. Once set, the package is automatically linked to any new card issued from that product.

This guide explains how to configure insurance on card products, issue cards with insurance, and manage the setup through the Dashboard and API.

## 1. Configure insurance on card products

When creating a card product, link it to a card insurance object by setting the [`defaultInsurancePackage`](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/card-insurance-configuration/#cardinsuranceconfigurationdefaultinsurancepackagecardinsurancepackage). 
This package is automatically applied when a card is issued.

You can also define the list of `availableInsurancePackages` for each card product.

By default, new card products include three packages: **Basic**, **Essential**, and **Premium**.

## 2. Card product review and validation

Once your configuration is complete, your PIM will review and validate the card product before it can be used.


## 3. Card insurance subscription

Swan automatically creates a [card insurance subscription](https://www.notion.so/Insurance-subscription-flow-229a3427555a80fd8351cbde27e41598?pvs=21) when a new card is issued, if the following conditions are met:

- The cardholder's account membership is `Enabled`  
- The account holder is `Verified`

## 4. Support claims easily

Your Web Banking app must include a link to the insurance provider's claims portal so users can file claims independently.

The `claimsUrl` is available in the `card` query response and points to the providerâ€™s portal.

```graphql
query {
  card(id: "card_id") {
    claimsUrl
  }
}
