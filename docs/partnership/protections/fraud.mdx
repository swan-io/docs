## Common types of fraud {#types}

<mark>To do: APP fraud (Authorised push payment (APP) fraud or bank transfer scams)</mark>

### Account takeover (ATO) {#types-ato}

Account takeover fraud occurs when those committing fraud gain control of a victim's payment account, then use the account to perform unauthorized actions.

:::note Tips to combat ATO fraud
- Keep account login information secure.
- Use strong, unique passwords and passcodes.
- Don't share account details by email, phone call, or text message.
:::

### Card fraud {#types-cards}

Those committing card fraud steal virtual card numbers and CVV security codes or actual physical cards.
Then, they use that information to make online or phone payments, where the purchaser's physical card or presence isn't required.

Types of card fraud include **remote purchase fraud**, **card not present (CNP) fraud**, and any fraudulent activity with **lost or stolen cards**.

They might also take misplaced cards and use them to make payments or withdraw money from an ATM.

:::note Tips to combat CNP fraud
- Only enter card details on websites with a secure connection.
- Only enter the card number and security code into fields designed for those numbers. Don't enter them in free-text fields.
- Block lost or stolen cards immediately. If you use Swan's Web Banking, send them the [Support Center article about blocking cards](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/18538920070045-Blocking-your-card).

### CEO fraud {#types-ceo}

CEO fraud, sometimes referred to as business email compromise (BEC), involves those committing fraud impersonating a company's CEO or other executives, usually in a written format such as email.
Through these emails, they attempt to trick recipients into transferring funds, providing access to secure portals or documents, or otherwise revealing confidential information about the company.

The messages can be quite convincing and tend to leave recipients feeling rushed into helping a top-level executive with an urgent task.

:::note Tips to combat CEO fraud
- **Confirm the email address**. Is there a typo in the executive's name? Is the domain name exactly correct?
- If you've received other emails from this executive, **does this email look like the others**? Or are there slight differences in style, spacing, and voice?
- Even when a request comes from a company executive, **never bypass established security measures**.
- **Contact the executive using another channel**. If you received an email, for example, try calling them or sending them a direct message on the company's messaging platform.

### Phishing {#types-phishing}

Phishing involves those committing fraud impersonating legitimate organizations, such as companies or governmental agencies, through email or text message.
They attempt to steal sensitive information, including user names and passwords, government ID numbers, financial information, and more.
Phishing emails and text messages can be quite convincing, and often include links to websites that look almost identical to the organization's real website.

:::note Tips to combat phishing
- **Contact the organization directly** in a new email or by phone to ask about the message you received.
- **Check links before you open them**. Is there a typo in the domain name? Are there extra characters at the beginning or end of the link?
- **Open websites directly** in your browser instead of clicking links included in an email or text message.
