## October - December 2023 {#2023-q4}

### 12 December

<h4>New features</h4>

🇫🇮 Our end-user interfaces are now available in Finnish.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

🤳🏾 To improve the user experience for some payment control use cases, the card spending limits are no longer displayed on the consent screen for the mutations `addCardsWithGroupDelivery`, `addCards`, and `updateCard` (exception: single-use virtual cards).

⚡ Instant transfers are activated by default when initiating SEPA Credit Transfers with Swan's Web Banking interface.
They fallback to regular transfers when instant isn't available.


🚓 To fight efficiently against money laundering, we implemented a new card ATM withdrawal spending limit.
These limits are enforced at the account holder level and can only be modified by Swan.
Review the limits

💼 We added the object `relatedCapitalDepositCase` to the shareholder query in order to provide details about the capital deposit case for any shareholder.

🪝 We added a new webhook, `CapitalDepositDocument.Created`, for when a new a document for a case or a shareholder is created.
List of webhooks

‼️ Reminder: the date for `addSepaDirectDebitPaymentMandate` must match the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Otherwise, we'll return a `ValidationRejection`.

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

⚠️ On February 5th, we're doing a database migration of our webhooks.
Only logs from January 1st on will be migrated, meaning all data from 2023 and before will be lost.
From February 5th on, webhook history will only be kept for 100 days.
This change won't impact the subscriptions.

### 30 November

<h4>New features</h4>

👤 Access identity verification details for you, either with the API or on your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Users**.
See their identification history, the identification levels they've validated, and why an identification attempt might have been rejected.
Because of this new feature, we're deprecating `user.identificationStatus`.


🆔 Swan offers a document-sharing feature, providing access to identity verification document metadata as well as the documents themselves.
Please submit a ticket through your Dashboard to learn more about this feature.


<h4>Improvements</h4>

🆔 Depending on your project's configuration, the notification informing account holders that their account is open will now also be triggered in Sandbox.


🪝 Receive webhooks when a capital deposit document is updated.
Using the new `capitalDepositDocument` query, retrieve its new status and, when rejected, the `reasonCode` with reason for the rejection.
List of webhooks

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

⚠️ In **4 weeks**, we're adding a new value to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum: `UltimateBeneficialOwnerProofOfAddress`.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 The deprecated field `isInstant` for `initiateCreditTransfers` was removed.
Please use `mode` instead to initiate SEPA Instant Credit Transfers.
By using `mode=InstantWithFallback`, your SEPA Instant Credit Transfers will ["fallback" to regular SEPA Credit Transfers](../topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/index.mdx#instant-fallback) if instant isn't available.

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

⚠️ In **4 weeks**, we're adding new values to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum: `LegalRepresentativeProofOfIdentity`, `UltimateBeneficialOwnerProofOfIdentity`, `NIFAccreditationCard`, `PresidentDecisionOfAppointment`, `AdministratorDecisionOfAppointment`, and `FinancialStatements`.

⚠️ In **4 weeks**, we'll remove the deprecated `users.search` filter.
Please use `users.filters.search` instead, which operates the same but requires at least 3 characters to search.

### 26 October

<h4>Improvements</h4>
 
🇩🇪 Get ready for better conversion rates when onboarding German individual accounts.
When verifying their identity, users can submit their identity document and their qualified electronic signature (QES) at the same time.

See an example

📬 The field `merchantPostalCode` has been added to the `card` query.

## April - June 2023 {#2023-q2}

### 26 June

🔍 There is a new `transactions` query to make searching transactions easier.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

📑 During the KYC process, you can upload supporting documents Swan requires from your end customers, and request a review.

✅ With Internal Direct Debit B2B, use the `addReceivedInternalDirectDebitB2bMandate` mutation to receive the debtor's consent when declaring a payment mandate.


📣 Sometimes, the KYC process is delayed because of website outages for European business registries.
Subscribe to the [Swan status page](https://status.swan.io/) to learn about these delays.
There is a new section called *Onboarding - European Business Registries* where we will post a live incident about who is affected and the overall level of impact.

### 22 June

<h4>New features</h4>

🪪 Swan takes another step forward to increase the conversion rate to onboard individual French accounts.
PVID (Prestataire Verification d'Identité à Distance) is the latest French identity verification process that provides a fast, secure way to onboard end-customers, with a better user experience.
Thanks to PVID, the first transfer or electronic signature is no longer required for EU users opening accounts with French IBANs.


<h4>Improvements</h4>

🇪🇺 Every word in every language for Web Banking, Onboarding, text messages, and more (almost 7000 words in 6 languages), was reviewed by our new localization team.
We hope your experience in the supported language of your choice improves significantly, and please continue sharing your language-specific feedback with us.

📈 We improved webhook performance and resiliency thanks to a full refactoring.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

📱 We'll no longer send a text message to users when their identity is successfully verified.
Why?

### 01 June

<h4>Improvements</h4>

💲 When a transaction is processed in a currency other than euros €, this currency with the converted amount is now displayed on your Dashboard.

🔎 On the Dashboard Accounts page, we added a "fees" option to the payment product filter.

⚡ When an instant transfer is requested but can't be processed for any reason, we automatically execute a regular transfer instead.
In the transaction history, users will see the method "transfer" instead of "instant transfer", and there will be an alert in the transaction details.
This is only for Swan Web Banking.

⏲️ The Time-To-Live (TTL, auto-disconnection) from both our Dashboard and Web Banking platforms have been reduced.

- Dashboard: reduced to 72 hours; the session will refresh every time an API call is sent.
- Web Banking: reduced to 5 minutes; the session token will refresh as long as the Web Banking page stays open.

🇪🇺 On your PDF account statements, amounts are now displayed in the local format based on the account language.
We'll continue to improve the localized experience.

👑 The project owner's legal representative can now see their card numbers with the API. Also, in Sandbox, promote any account holder in the project to project owner with the testing API mutation promoteAccountHolderToProjectOwner.

<h4>Bug fix</h4>

🇫🇷 From May 12th to May 15th, Bouygues Telecom blocked text message delivery to French phone numbers (+33), messages that included a link to authenticate.
As a quick fix, we will temporarily send https://link.swan.io instead of https://authmsg.co.

💳 In the `Card.Updated` webhook, `eventDate` changed to `updatedAt` (previously `createdAt`).

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

⏲️ To improve our webhook performance, we added a timeout of 15 seconds to endpoint requests. When there is no response after 15 seconds, the webhook fails and will automatically retry.

💥 In the `addCards` mutation, the input field `additionalEmbossedLine` is now **`additionalPrintedLine`** for consistency and user clarity.

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

📱 In **4 weeks**, Swan will stop sending a text message to users when their identity is successfully verified.

Initiate an outgoing Instant SEPA Credit Transfer, then reject it using `simulateOutgoingSepaCreditTransferRejection` mutation.
Use `reasonCode`: `BeneficiaryBankNotReachable`.

🫢 Upcoming outgoing Instant SEPA Credit Transfer can be canceled using the `cancelTransaction` mutation.

✍️ The `externalReference` field in `initiateCreditTransfers` is now working for outgoing Instant SEPA Credit Transfer.

To do so, you'll need to design a custom card with your Technical Account Manager and include this additional line.
Contact us if you're interested in [designing a custom card](../topics/cards/design/guide-custom.mdx), or [adapting an existing design](../topics/cards/physical/guide-print.mdx#print-additional-line).

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 To avoid undesired behaviors with our API, we changed the accepted date format for two fields in the Onboarding API:

- `IndividualUltimateBeneficialOwnerInput.birthDate` must be a date `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `IndividualUltimateBeneficialOwner.birthDate` format change from `dateTime` to `date`

## January - March 2023 {#2023-q1}

### 29 March

<h4>New features</h4>

⚡ We implemented a [fallback option](../topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/index.mdx#instant-fallback) for Instant SEPA Credit Transfers.
When an instant transfer is unavailable, whether for technical reasons or due to a manual risk assessment, the instant transfer will run as a standard transfer instead.
Your customer won't need to reinitiate a transfer or consent a second time.

- **How?** We added a new input mode to the `initiateCreditTransfer` mutation, as well as the new filter `includeRejectedWithFallback` to the transactions query.
- **Tip**: We recommend you choose `false` by default so your customers won't see the rejected instant transfer on their transaction history.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

📃 To reduce back and forth with our KYC team, we're asking some partners to collect additional supporting documents during onboarding for some use cases:

- Lithuanian companies: Company Registration, UBO Declaration
- Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg companies: UBO Declaration
- German self-employed: Self-employed Registration

🇩🇪 For German account onboarding (`accountCountry: DEU`), three fields are now API-optional:

- UBO birth date: `individualUltimateBeneficialOwners.birthDate`
- UBO birth city: `individualUltimateBeneficialOwners.birthCity`
- UBO birth postal code: `individualUltimateBeneficialOwners.birthCityPostalCode`

📼 We added a new field `originTransaction` to the API at the `transaction` level.
It contains its parent `transaction` (for example, the card debit for a card debit reversal).

🧪 We added Instant SEPA Credit Transfers and their associated recalls to the [Event Simulator](../developers/tools/event-simulator.mdx) on your Dashboard.

💳 You can now approve authorizations with a partial amount.
To do so, indicate the `partialAuthorizationAmountValue` within your [payment control](../developers/using-api/payment-control.mdx) response.
Note that not all authorizations can be authorized partially; to identify eligible authorizations, look for the `allowsPartialAuthorization:true` on the payment control notification we send you.

<h4>Bug fix</h4>

⚒️ We fixed some latency issues on our OAuth 2.0 server.
Let us know if you still have trouble getting your access tokens.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 We added a new value `SwornStatement` in `SupportingDocumentPurposeEnum`.
To avoid breaking changes on your side, please take these into account.
We'll request this supporting document during onboarding for Spanish companies.

### 21 March

<h4>New features</h4>

🎨 The onboarding and transfer pages have a fresh, new design.
And guess what?
We'll be ready to share our code and design system with you in the coming weeks.

📈 We added Capital Deposits to the **Dashboard** > **Data** section, which was the first step to removing the current Dashboard.
Next, you'll be able to upload documents and simulate everything with the [Event Simulator](../developers/tools/event-simulator.mdx).

### 28 February

<h4>New features</h4>

🇩🇪 [IBANs starting with `DE`](../topics/accounts/ibans/index.mdx#local) are live after 3 successful months in beta.
You can use them via the API or no-code, across all use cases including B2B and B2C!
To test them, use the new German onboarding link.
You'll find it in your Dashboard, on the Settings/Onboarding tab.
The German onboarding flow is a little different, in order to comply with German law.
Learn more about requirements for [individual](../topics/onboarding/individual/#country-reqs) and [company](../topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs) German accounts.

🪪 Verify the identity of individual account holders using a [Qualified Electronic Signature](../topics/users/identifications/index.mdx#levels-processes).
This new identification level is mandatory for  individual German IBANs but can also be used for individual French IBANs in order to avoid the first transfer to finalize their identification process.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

⚡ Our reachability on Instant SEPA Credit Transfers has been extended to TIPS in addition to EBA-RT1.
We're now connected to most banks for initiating and receiving these transactions.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 We will begin using some changes we already warned you about, and have added them to the Graph.
To avoid breaking changes on your side, please take these into account:

- New transaction types: `SepaInstantCreditTransferInRecall` and `SepaInstantCreditTransferOutRecall`.
- New rejection reason codes for `SepaInstantCreditTransferOut` transactions: `CreditorBankTechnicalErrorOccurred` and `CreditorBankTimeout`.

### 20 February

<h4>New features</h4>

This makes it easy for our no-code customers to finalize the account holder verification process.
Just follow the steps.

✉️ Non-verified users can now use reset passcode by email.


💰 On March 1st 2023, we will start charging banking fees directly on your customers' Swan accounts.
This is the first phase of our [billing project](../topics/accounts/billing/index.mdx).
Ultimately, this will enable you to choose which fees you want to charge your customers through Swan, and lead to additional revenue.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

📃 You can now use the `accountStatement` query to [return an account statement](../topics/accounts/index.mdx#statements) from its `id`.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 As mentioned in past release notes, the new rejection reasons for `CardOut` transactions are as follows: `RetryWithChipAndPin`, `PinRequiredForFurtherTransaction`, `InvalidSecurityNumber`, and `InvalidExpirationDate`.

This was already available in the no-code interface and now it's in the API.
