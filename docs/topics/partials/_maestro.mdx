Some physical card terminals in the Netherlands refuse Mastercard transactions.
Therefore, Swan **offers a Maestro fallback** for [qualified physical cards](../cards/physical/index.mdx#maestro).

If the fallback is used to complete a transaction, the API returns the **masked Maestro card information** when queried for transaction details.
The masked information also appears in the transaction history on your Dashboard and Swan's Web Banking interface.
