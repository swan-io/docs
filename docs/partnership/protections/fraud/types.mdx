## Account takeover (ATO) {#ato}

ATO fraud occurs when fraudulent individuals gain control of a victim's payment account, and then use the account to perform unauthorized actions.

:::note Tips to combat ATO fraud
- Keep account **login information secure**.
- Use **strong, unique passwords** and passcodes.
- **Don't share account details** by email, phone call, or text message.
- Set up **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** or **two-factor authentication (2FA)** as an extra layer of security in case credentials are compromised.
- Only access the account from **trusted and secure networks**.
:::

## Card {#card}

Those committing card fraud **steal virtual card details**, such as card numbers and card verification values or codes (CVVs or CVCs), or **actual physical cards**.
Then, they use that information to make payments online or by phone, where the purchaser's physical card or presence isn't required.

Types of card fraud include **remote purchase fraud**, **card not present (CNP) fraud**, and any activity with **lost**, **stolen**, or **misplaced cards**.

:::note Tips to combat card fraud
- Only enter card details on websites with a **secure connection**.
- Only enter card numbers and security codes into **fields designed for those numbers**. Don't enter card details in free-text fields, which are open for any type of text input.
- **Block (cancel) lost or stolen cards immediately**. If you use Swan's Web Banking, send your users the [Support Center article about blocking cards](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150/articles/18538920070045-Blocking-your-card).
- **Prioritize issuing [single-use virtual cards](../../../topics/cards/virtual/index.mdx#suv)** for non-recurring online payments because these cards are more difficult to use fraudulently.

## Chief Executive Officer (CEO) {#ceo}

CEO fraud is a cybercrime where individuals impersonate a company's CEO or other top executive.
It's a type of authorized push payment (APP) fraud and also known as business email compromise (BEC).

These individuals send **convincing emails** to company employees that seem to require **immediate and urgent attention**.
In the email, they might ask the employee to transfer funds, provide access to secure portals or documents, or otherwise reveal confidential information about the company.

Consider the following example of a CEO vishing attack:

> Subject: Urgent financial matter (confidential)
>
> Hi Alex,
>
> There's been an urgent development and we need to pay an invoice immediately.
> I'm in a critical meeting and can't send this transaction myself.
> Could you please handle it right away?
>
> *includes transfer details*
>
> Let me know when it's done.
>
> Thanks,<br />
> Jules<br />
> CEO, MyBrand

:::note Tips to combat CEO fraud
- **Confirm the email address**. Is there a spelling error or typo in the executive's name? Are there extra characters, letters, or numbers in the domain name?
- If you've received other emails from this executive, **does this email look like the others**? Are there slight differences in style, spacing, and voice?
- Even when a request comes from an executive, **never bypass established security measures**.
- **Contact the executive using another established channel**. If you received an email, for example, try calling them or sending them a direct message on the company's messaging platform.

## Invoice and billing {#invoice-billing}

Invoice and billing fraud involves the use of fake invoices to trick companies.

Fraudulent individuals might **send companies fake invoices** that appear to be from the company's regular suppliers.
These invoices often **look authentic**, complete with logos and other details.
However, the **bank account details** included on the invoice **belong to the fraudulent individuals** rather than a legitimate supplier.

:::note Tips to combat invoice and billing fraud
- **Establish and respect rigorous processes**, including purchase verification systems, payment validation processes, transaction verification methods, and more.
- Regularly **verify supplier credentials**.
- **Maintain strong, direct lines of communication** with suppliers, and contact the supplier directly in case of suspicion.

## Phishing, vishing, and smishing {#phishing}

Phishing, vishing, and smishing involve fraudulent individuals **impersonating legitimate organizations**, such as companies or governmental agencies, contacting you by email, phone, or text message.
All three are types of authorized push payment (APP) fraud.

- **Phishing** → email
- **Vishing** → phone call
- **Smishing** → text message

They attempt to **steal sensitive information**, including user names and passwords, government ID numbers, financial information, and more.
These emails, phone calls, and text messages can be **quite convincing**.
For example, email and text messages often link to websites that look almost identical to an organization's real website.

:::note Tips to combat phishing, vishing, and smishing fraud
- Don't provide information or funds **urgently**.
- **Contact the organization directly** using a different communication channel to ask them about the suspicious message. For example, if they contacted you by phone, send an email. If you received a text message, call them.
- **Check links before you open them**. Is there a spelling error or typo in the domain name? Are there extra characters, letters, or numbers in the link?
- **Open websites directly** in your browser instead of clicking links included in an email or text message.
- Set up **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** or **two-factor authentication (2FA)** as an extra layer of security in case credentials are compromised by an attack.
