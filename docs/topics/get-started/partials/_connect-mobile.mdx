Swan authenticates you, a physical person, to the Swan system with your **mobile device** and **phone number**.
Developers and end users follow the same process, so everyone logging into Swan must use their mobile device.

Connecting with your device logs you into the Swan Dashboard, the **command center** for your integration.
