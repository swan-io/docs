# Resend membership invitation notification

If an invited account member doesn't receive their invitation email, you can resend it using the [`sendAccountMembershipInviteNotification` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/send-account-membership-invite-notification/).

This guide explains how to send partner-branded email notifications when inviting account members.

## Guide {#guide}

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- You must authenticate with a **user access token** associated with an existing account member who has the `canManageAccountMembership` permission.
- Only account members with the `canManageAccountMembership` permission can send invitation notifications.
- The account membership status must be `InvitationSent`.
- You can resend invitations up to **five times per day** per membership.

### Step 1: Call the mutation {#call-mutation}

Call the `sendAccountMembershipInviteNotification` mutation with the `accountMembershipId` of the membership for which you want to send the invitation.

You can optionally include a `redirectUrl` parameter.
When the end user completes the OAuth flow, they are automatically redirected to your redirect URL with an [authorization code and state](../../../developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user.mdx#code-receive).
If you include a `redirectUrl`, it must be registered in your **Dashboard**.
If you don't include one, the user is redirected to Swan's Web Banking.

```graphql {4} showLineNumbers
mutation ResendInvitation {
  sendAccountMembershipInviteNotification(
    # redirectUrl is optional; if provided, it must be registered in your Dashboard
    input: { accountMembershipId: "$YOUR_ACCOUNT_MEMBERSHIP_ID", redirectUrl: "$YOUR_REDIRECT_URL" }
  ) {
    ... on SendAccountMembershipInviteNotificationSuccessPayload {
      __typename
      notificationRequestId
    }
    ... on AccountMembershipNotFoundRejection {

}
```

### Step 2: Receive the confirmation {#confirmation}

The API returns a `notificationRequestId` that you can use to track the email delivery if needed.

If a user reports problems with email delivery, provide this ID to [Swan Support](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150) to help investigate the issue.

```json {4} showLineNumbers
{
  "data": {
    "sendAccountMembershipInviteNotification": {
      "__typename": "SendAccountMembershipInviteNotificationSuccessPayload",
      "notificationRequestId": "3f5a787a-5709-43a2-90dd-7508b71cdf7b"
    }
  }
}
```

:::info Delivery status
The API currently does not display the delivery status of notifications. Please contact [Swan Support](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150) if you encounter any issues with email delivery.

## Rejection reasons {#rejections}

The mutation can return several rejection reasons if the request can't be completed:

| Rejection | Reason |
|---|---|
| `AccountMembershipNotFoundRejection` | The account membership ID doesn't exist. |
| `AccountMembershipStatusNotEligibleRejection` | The account membership status must be `InvitationSent` to send an invitation notification. |
| `AccountMembershipCustomInvitationCannotBeCreatedRejection` | The invitation link can't be created for this account membership. |
| `MaximumDailyInvitationsReachedRejection` | You've reached the maximum of five invitation emails per day for this membership. |
| `UserNotAllowedToManageAccountMembershipRejection` | The authenticated user doesn't have the `canManageAccountMembership` permission. |
| `UserNotAllowedToSendAccountMembershipInvitationRejection` | The user's account membership status must be `Enabled` to send invitations. |
| `ForbiddenRejection` | The operation is forbidden in the current context. |
| `ValidationRejection` | The request contains validation errors. |

## Notification details {#details}

The invitation notification email:

- Is sent from `do-not-reply@swan.io`.
- Is sent to the email address specified when creating the account membership.
- Uses the account member's preferred language if set, otherwise the account's default language.
- Includes your partner branding (logo and accent colors).
- Contains a link for the invited member to accept the invitation and bind their Swan user account to the membership.
- Can be translated into multiple languages automatically.

If you have feedback about notification translations, contact [Swan Support](https://support.swan.io/hc/en-150) and specify the notification and language.
