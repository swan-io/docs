### New features

📄 [Generate transaction statements](/topics/payments/#transactions-statements) with the API to prove a transaction was executed by Swan.
Today, the mutation works for incoming and outgoing `Booked` SEPA Credit Transfers.
Up next, we'll make the feature available on your Dashboard and in Swan's Web Banking, as well as for other transaction types.

👥 Add [trusted beneficiaries](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/#beneficiaries) with the API and Web Banking to facilitate credit transfers.
Account members can send credit transfers to beneficiaries according to their [membership permissions](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/#beneficiaries-permissions).
This provides an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of sending transfers to unintended recipients.

### Breaking change

ℹ️ As announced on [August 29th](/changelog/29-august-2024), we implemented a [webhook subscription limit](/developers/using-api/webhooks#subscription-limits).
In order to avoid overconsumption, you're now restricted to 10 subscriptions per Sandbox event and 5 subscriptions per Live event.
