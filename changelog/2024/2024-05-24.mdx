### New features

🪝 You can now [manage webhooks automatically with the API](/developers/using-api/webhooks/#event-handling-api).
Use the API to create webhooks dynamically, retry failed events automatically, and keep track of webhook delivery.

### Improvements

⏸️ When an account is suspended or reactivated, we now trigger an `Account.Updated` webhook notification.

🙅🏻 You can now check your Dashboard the reason a [capital deposit document](/topics/capital-deposits/#documents) was refused.

📃 If a KBIS document for a newly-created company is refused at the end of a [French capital deposit process](/topics/capital-deposits/france/guide), you can now upload a new one and we'll process it again.


### Upcoming breaking changes

🪪 In **4 weeks**, we will deprecate the `notStarted` [identification status](/topics/users/identifications/#statuses) and replace it with `Started` to streamline identification flows and reduce confusion.

💳 In **4 weeks**, we will start using the new following issued card [rejection reason codes](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/rejected-reason-code/): `ThreeDsError`, `PeriodTransactionNumberLimitExceeded`, `MissingExpirationDate`, `MissingPin`, `DigitalWalletDeactivated`, `DigitalWalletEnrolmentInvalid`, `DigitalWalletTokenInvalid`, `DigitalWalletRefusal`, `DigitalWalletSuspended`, `InvalidAmount`, and `CardholderCancellation`.
The new rejection reasons are available in Sandbox using the [Event Simulator](/developers/tools/event-simulator).
