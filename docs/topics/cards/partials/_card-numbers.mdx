<p>Why do <b>virtual</b> and <b>physical</b> cards have different card numbers and CVCs?
The two card types function as independent entities.
Each has its own transaction history, can be added to the same digital wallet, and more.</p>
<p>This also means that if a cardholder loses their physical card, they can suspend or cancel the physical card <b>without losing access</b> to their virtual card.</p>
