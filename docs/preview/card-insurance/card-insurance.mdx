title: Card insurance

:::caution No coverage for existing cards
Card insurance is currently in private beta.
:::

## Overview {#overview}

Swan now offers insurance packages that can be added to payment cards, providing extra protection for cardholders. Partners can choose to create cards with embedded insurance or without it.

There are three standard insurance packages available:

- **Basic**
- **Essential**
- **Premium**

Once an insurance package is assigned to a card product, all new cards created under that product will automatically include the chosen insurance by default.

:::caution No coverage for existing cards
Insurance is not retroactive. Existing cards won't be updated automatically. To add insurance, you must issue a new card.
:::

## Card insurance coverage {#insurance-coverage}

The following tables outline the card insurance coverage included with Swan cards. 

:::info Specific coverage 
Specific coverage varies by **insurance plan**. To consult the details of a card's insurance coverage, please **request the terms and conditions notice** directly from your PIM (Product Integration Manager).

## Insurance subscription {#insurance-subscription}

### Insurance subscription statuses {#subscription-statuses}

When a user orders a card with insurance, Swan begins the process of creating an insurance subscription with our insurance partner.

The subscription progresses through these statuses in order: **Pending** → **Processing** → **Enabled**, or **Canceled** (if the associated card is canceled).

```

| Status | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `Pending`| Insurance subscription is waiting for the account membership to be `Enabled`, and the account holder to be `Verified`. |
| `Processing`| The insurance subscription request is sent to the insurance partner for adhesion. |
| `Enabled` | The insurance subscription is active and insurance is valid. <br/><br/>If you're subscribed to the `cardInsuranceSubscription.Created` webhook, you'll receive a notification when a subscription is `Enabled`. |
| `Canceled`| The insurance subscription is `Canceled` when the associated card is canceled. |

### Insurance subscription flow {#subscription-flow}

When a card product with insurance is ordered, Swan creates an insurance subscription (called an "adhesion" by the insurance partner). Swan automatically applies the insurance package set for the card product.

### Sequence diagram

The following diagram details a common flow of how the user, Your system (you), Swan and the insurance partner interact when ordering a new card with embedded insurance.

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Your system
    participant Swan
    participant Insurance partner

    alt User orders card via Web Banking
        User->>Swan: Orders card
    else You order card via API
        Your system->>Swan: Calls card creation API
        Note over Your system,Swan: addCard, addCards, or addCardsWithGroupDelivery
    end

    Swan-->>Your system: Returns card with insurancePackageId
    Swan->>User: Shows consent screen
    User->>Swan: Accepts terms
    Swan->>Your system: Webhook: subscription.Created
    Note over Swan: Waits for: <br> Account membership = Enabled <br />& Account holder = Verified
    Swan->>Insurance partner: Creates subscription
    Insurance partner-->>Swan: Confirms & activates
    Swan->>Your system: Webhook: subscription.Updated
```
### Steps

1. A card is ordered by either:
   - **The user**, through their Web Banking interface.
   - **You**, through the API using one of the following mutations:  
     `addCard` (single card), `addCards` (multiple cards), or `addCardsWithGroupDelivery` (multiple cards with shared delivery).

2. An `insurancePackageId` is attributed to the card.

3. **Swan sends a consent request to your user**, and they review and **accept the insurance terms** on the consent screen. 
This screen is localized based on the account member's language.

4. After consent, **Swan sends a** `cardInsuranceSubscription.Created` **webhook** to your system.

5. Swan creates the **insurance subscription** (called an "adhesion" by our insurance partner).

:::caution
Insurance subscription creation only happens when the account membership is `Enabled` and the account holder verification status is `Verified`. The creation of a subscription may be **delayed** until these conditions are met.
:::

5. **Swan sends a** `cardInsuranceSubscription.Updated` **webhook** to your system once the insurance partner confirms the subscription.

:::info Card insurance activation
Once subscribed, the insurance is automatically activated. Your user can view the insurance notice, and access the URL to the insurance claims portal through their Web Banking interface.

## Card insurance claims {#insurance-claims}

When an eligible event occurs, cardholders should submit a claim through the **insurance claims portal**, or by contacting our assistance provider, depending on the type of claim.

### Reporting a card insurance claim {#report-insurance-claims}

#### Reporting through the claims portal

The insurance claims portal is available in the cardholder's Web Banking interface. 
It's typically used for standard claims such as:
- Lost documents
- Travel delays
- Purchase protection
- Card fraud

To submit a claim, cardholders must:
1. Create an account in the insurance claims portal using the email linked to their Swan account.
1. Upload the required documents.
1. Track the progress of their claim in the insurance claims portal.

Our **insurance partner handles the entire claims process** after it's submitted. 
Cardholders must follow up directly through the portal. 
If compensation is approved, it's credited directly to the cardholder's Swan account.

:::info Customized claims portal    
By default, the claims management interface provided by our insurance partner is co-branded with **your logo and accent color**, like your Swan interfaces (Web Banking and consent screens).
:::

#### Reporting to our assistance provider

Our assistance provider handles urgent claims such as:
- Medical emergencies  
- Repatriation  
- Hospitalisation  
- Legal assistance

These must be reported **by phone** for immediate support.

They handle the entire claims process. 
If compensation is approved, it is credited directly to the cardholder's Swan account.
