When sending a first transfer to a limited account, be aware of the following restrictions:

- SEPA Credit Transfers exceeding €50 are automatically rejected.
- SEPA Credit Transfers that would cause the account balance to exceed €150 are automatically rejected.
- International Credit Transfers, regardless of their amount, are automatically rejected.

These restrictions apply while the account holder is completing verification and the account remains in `Limited` status.
Users should send a first SEPA Credit Transfer of €50 or less that won't cause the balance to exceed €150.
