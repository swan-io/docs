### New features

✅ We added a new account activation tab to the Web Banking.
This makes it easy for our no-code customers to finalize the account holder verification process.
Just follow the steps.

✉️ Non-verified users can now use reset passcode by email.

💰 On March 1st 2023, we will start charging banking fees directly on your customers' Swan accounts.
This is the first phase of our [billing project](/topics/accounts/billing).
Ultimately, this will enable you to choose which fees you want to charge your customers through Swan, and lead to additional revenue.

### Improvements

📃 You can now use the `accountStatement` query to [return an account statement](/topics/accounts) from its `id`.

### Breaking changes

💥 As mentioned in past release notes, the new rejection reasons for `CardOut` transactions are as follows: `RetryWithChipAndPin`, `PinRequiredForFurtherTransaction`, `InvalidSecurityNumber`, and `InvalidExpirationDate`.
These have been added to the Graph.
Please take them into account to avoid breaking changes on your side.
