### New features

🇳🇱 Dutch accounts can now receive incoming [Instant SEPA Credit Transfers](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa). Outgoing instant transfers will be available soon.

💸 As part of the European Payment Accounts Directive, we included an annual fees statement in this month's account statement.
This is available on the last page of the PDF automatically generated for January 2024.

### Improvements

🛡️ For security reasons, we added a new screen on the desktop-to-mobile flow when a [user signs up](/topics/users).
They need to confirm their own mobile phone number.
