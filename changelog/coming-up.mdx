  <summary>⚠️ **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

💳 Starting **August 21st**, refund transactions will be linked to the `paymentId` of their original debit authorization when referenced by merchants. This change affects you only if you expect debit clearing transactions on a debit authorization.

📄 Starting **August 28th**, we'll start using these new, already available enum variables: `USPersonStatusDeclaration` and `ProofOfBusinessActivity` for [SupportingDocumentPurpose](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/supporting-document-purpose/), and `W9`, `W8`, and `CertificateOfLossOfNationality` for [SupportingDocumentType](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/supporting-document-type/).

📖 Starting **October 9th**, the new **[Verification of Payee](https://docs.swan.io/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/verification-of-payee/)** regulation takes effect.

👥 Starting **December 31st**, the `bookedBalanceAfter` field will be removed from the transaction query. Please use the `balanceAfter.amount` on `BookedTransactionStatusInfo`.
