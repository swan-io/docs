## New features

💳 You can now disable users from updating their card settings in Swan's Web Banking from your **Dashboard** > **Web banking** settings tab. 
When disabled, users with the `CanUpdateCards` permission can only update card limits through your product, not Web Banking.

## Improvements

🧭 We've made several improvements to your **Dashboard**:
- The Dashboard search now returns more **accurate results**. 
Results automatically narrow as you type and add more details.
This update is available on the Account Holders, Onboarding, Account, Account Memberships, and Capital Deposits pages.
- **Filters** have a new look across all Dashboard pages to help you find data more efficiently.
We added **quick filters** for all **verification statuses** on the Account Holders page based on user feedback.
We **removed the Verifications page** because the new filters provide the same information in a more accessible way.

🔍 We've added [new filters](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/transactions-filters-input/) to enhance searching for [transaction information](/topics/payments/overview/guide-get-transaction-info/) by **amount** and **execution date** in the **API**:

- **Amount** filters: we added `isAboveAmount` and `isBelowAmount`. We also updated the `amount` filter to return an exact match.
These filters are now cumulative and will replace the current `amount` field in the transactions search filter (*see upcoming breaking change*).
- **Execution date** filters: we added `isAfterExecutionDate` and `isBeforeExecutionDate`.

✍️ The `requestMerchantPaymentMethods` mutation now validates your [SEPA Creditor Identifier (SCI)](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/#sci) when you request [SEPA Direct Debit](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/guide-request/).
If the SCI is invalid, the mutation will reject it, helping you avoid blocked transactions in the future.

📝 You can now retrieve all transactions initiated by a standing order using the `standingOrder.transactions` [query](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/standing-order/#standingordertransactionstransactionconnection-).

## API updates
