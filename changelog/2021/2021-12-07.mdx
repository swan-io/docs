<h4>New features</h4>

👥 [Add up to 200 account memberships](/topics/accounts/memberships/guide-add-multiple) using just one consent with the `addAccountMemberships` mutation.

💳 [Add up to 200 cards](/topics/cards/virtual/guide-add#add-multiple), and print their physical version using just one consent with the `addCards` mutation. Since card creation is executed asynchronously, we created a new card status: `Processing`. We deprecated the `status` filter on the `cards` query and created `statuses` so you can filter when there are multiple ones.

✅ The new [`ibanValidation` query](/topics/accounts/ibans/guide-validate) helps you verify the format of an external IBAN, get all available bank info (name, BIC code, etc.) and account data available for this IBAN, as well as the reachability of this IBAN across all SEPA schemes.

📃 [Sepa Direct Debit Core Mandates](/topics/payments/direct-debit#mandates) are now visible in the API under the account.`receivedDirectDebitMandates` query and can be suspended with the `suspendReceivedDirectDebitMandate` mutation or resumed with the `resumeReceivedDirectDebitMandate` mutation.

🤳🏾 During SCA, avoid asking your customer to enter their phone number, first name, last name, and birth date on the Swan user form. Query parameters during the [oauth 2 process](/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user#code-receive) let you do this.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

🪝 Some webhook events used to be fired a few milliseconds too early, and now are fired right on time.

🔄 Just in case a webhook event is incorrectly integrated on your side, we've added a retry button to the dashboard.

📬 Simulate physical card delivery from the dashboard.

🇪🇺 Our compliance team did a lot of work to allow you to onboard individuals and now companies [across all of Europe](/partnership/overview/country-coverage).
