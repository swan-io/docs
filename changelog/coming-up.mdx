  <summary>⚠️ **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

    🛡️ Starting **December 18**, we're introducing stricter input validation for several mutations to improve security and error handling.

    📩 Starting **December 18**, the [account membership invitation](/topics/accounts/memberships/#notifications) notification will be rebranded with your project's branding (logo, accent colors). If you use a forked version of Web Banking, fetch and deploy the latest version from Swan's repository to continue receiving Swan-sent invitation emails.

    ⚠️ On **January 23, 2026**, the following fields will be removed from the [`accountStatement`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/account-statement/) and [`accountStatements`](https://api-reference.swan.io/queries/account-statements/) queries and from the [`generateAccountStatement` mutation](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/generate-account-statement/) response:

    - `fees` is replaced by `feeCredits` and `feeDebits`.
    - `status` is replaced by the `statusInfo` object.
    - The statement download `url`, previously in the `type` object, is now only in `statusInfo`.

    🧹 On **February 5, 2026**, the deprecated `status` field will be removed from the [`CapitalDepositCase` object](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/capital-deposit-case/). Use the `statusInfo` field (introduced October 23, 2025) instead. The `statusInfo` field provides more granular status updates including `WaitingForInitialRequirements`, `PendingInternalReview`, and `WaitingForAdditionalInformation`.
