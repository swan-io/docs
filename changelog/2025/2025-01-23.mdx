## New features

üîî [Consent notifications](/topics/users/consent/guide-configure-notifications/) are now more reliable.
If your endpoint doesn‚Äôt answer correctly, notifications automatically fall back to text messages.
Users can also choose to receive text messages instead of in-app notifications with a new button on the consent screen.

‚öôÔ∏è Onboarding now includes a new field, [`acquisitionChannel`](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/acquisition-channel), which provides valuable insights to support our efforts in fighting against financial crime.
Set the field to one of the following values: `InboundOrganic`, `InboundReferral`, `OutboundSales`, and `OutboundAccountingFirm`.

## Improvements

üß≠ Get a more up-to-date view of your card transactions.
We now process the booking of issued card transactions more regularly, with twice as many batches per day.
