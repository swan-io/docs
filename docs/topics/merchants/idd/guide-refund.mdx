# Refund an Internal Direct Debit transaction

Refunding an `InternalDirectDebitOut` transaction triggers the creation of two new transactions:

1. First, a new debit transaction (_Return Executed_ on the `InternalDirectDebitOut`).
1. Then, a new credit transaction (_Return Received_ on the `InternalDirectDebitIn`).

Refunds must be processed by Swan.
Please send an email to support@swan.io.
