# Account memberships

## Overview {#overview}

Account membership **grants rights** to a Swan user who **isn't the account holder**.

The Swan user who performs the account's onboarding is the first account member and becomes the account's legal representative.
All Swan accounts have at least one account member: the legal representative, and they're considered the admin of the account.
The admin can then grant other Swan users permission to perform certain actions for the account; each of these users is an account member.

> Consider a real-life example: a grandparent might want their grandchild to have access to an account to purchase groceries.
> The grandparent is the account holder, and the grandchild, an account member.

Account memberships are **especially useful for company accounts**.
The legal representative grants permissions to other employees.
Employees can then manage their own payments, such as software or sales expenses, independently.
The company's accountant can use their membership to access account statements.
With enough permissions, managers can add cards for their team.
How you use account memberships and the corresponding permissions is up to you—the possibilities are almost endless to fulfill your use case.

Swan users can have memberships to an **unlimited** number of Swan accounts.

Consider the following example, where Sasha Oliveira has account memberships to account for MyBrand and eFounders.
Sasha can access and manage memberships for both accounts, but only manage cards for one.

## Membership permissions {#permissions}

Account members can be assigned **different rights to an account**, allowing access to only the desired actions and information.
These rights are referred to as **permissions** in the Swan API and Web Banking interface.

Swan doesn't offer role-base access control (RBAC).
Instead, you choose exactly what each account member can see and do on a member-by-member basis.

| Permission | Account member can... |
| --- | --- |
| `canViewAccount` | View the account and information about the account, including main and virtual IBANs, beneficiaries, payment mandates, list of transactions and transaction details, and more |
| `canManageBeneficiaries` | Add or remove beneficiaries |
| `canInitiatePayments` | Initiate (send) transfers to beneficiaries |
| `canManageAccountMembership` | Add, modify, or remove account memberships |
| `canManageCards` | View, add, and update their own cards and cards for account memberships they manage |

### Granting permissions {#permissions-grant}

In order to grant permissions to other account members, the account member must have the permission `canManageAccountMembership`.
They can only grant permissions they already have.

For example, if an account member doesn't have the `canManageCards` permission, they can't grant it to another account member.
If they try to grant the `canManageCards` permission anyway, the API returns a `PermissionCannotBeGrantedRejection` error.

### Adding cards {#permissions-cards}

Whether your account members can add cards and for whom depends on both `canManageAccountMembership` and `canManageCards` permissions.

| `canManage`... | `AccountMembership` = true | `AccountMembership` = false |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Cards` = **true** | ✓ View, add, and update cards for self<br />✓ View, add, and update cards for others∗ | ✓ View, add, and update cards for self<br />☒ Can't view, add, or update cards for others |
| `Cards` = **false** | ✓ View my own cards<br />☒ Can't add or update cards for self<br />☒ Can't view, add, or update cards for others | ✓ View my own cards<br />☒ Can't add or update cards for self<br />☒ Can't view, add, or update cards for others |
| `Cards` = **not provided** | ✓ View, add, and update cards for self<br />✓ View, add, and update cards for others | ✓ View, add, and update cards for self<br />☒ Can't view, add, or update cards for others |

∗ *others* → other account members

### No permissions {#permissions-none}

You can add account members without granting them any membership permissions.
For example, if you want to give a user a card associated with the account, but you don't want them to view account information or perform any actions for the account, you'd add an account membership with no permissions.

In this case, all membership permission booleans are `false`.
This type of invitation doesn't require consent from the account holder and skips the status `InvitationSent`.

## Membership language {#language}

The language for your account membership is **inherited** based on how the membership is added.

- When **invited by API**, the membership language is determined by the `accept-language` header of the `bindAccountMembership` API call.
- When **invited by banking interface**, it's determined by the invitee's browser language.

| Account membership status | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `ConsentPending` | Request to add an account membership was sent with the `addAccountMembership` mutation and is waiting for the account holder's consent.<br/><br/>Memberships with the status `ConsentPending` can't be updated. If there's an error in the invited account member's information, cancel the invitation and add a new membership with the `addAccountMembership` mutation.<br/><br/>**Next steps**:<ul><li>If the account holder consents, the status moves to `InvitationSent`</li><li>If the account holder doesn't consent, the status moves to `Disabled`</li></ul> |
| `InvitationSent` | An invitation was sent to the invited account member.<br/><br/>**Next steps**:<ul><li>If the invited account member accepts the invitation and provides personal information that **matches** the information Swan already has about them, the status moves to `Enabled`</li><li>If the invited account member accepts the invitation, but provides personal information that **doesn't match** the information Swan already has about them, the status moves to `BindingUserError`</li><li>If the invited account member declines the membership, the status moves to `Disabled`</li></ul> |
| `Enabled` | All user information matches, the account member's identity is verified, and the account member can use their account membership and corresponding permissions. |
| `BindingUserError` | The personal information submitted by the invited account member doesn't match the information provided to Swan during account onboarding. The mismatch must be solved before continuing.<br/><br/>Refer to the [section on user binding errors](#binding-error) for more information. |
| `Suspended` | Account membership is suspended and not available for use.<br/><br/>Account memberships can be suspended for various reasons, including a request from you or the account holder, or a Swan action in the case of suspicious activity.<br/><br/>**Next steps**:<ul><li>Restore the account membership's previous status with the API</li><li>Cancel the account membership with the API</li></ul> |
| `Disabled` | Account membership is disabled, is no longer available for use, and can't be restored. |

### Binding user errors {#binding-errors}

When the personal information submitted by the invited account member doesn't match the information provided to Swan during account onboarding, the account membership has the status `BindingUserError`.

At least one of the following booleans must be true for an account membership to have a binding error:

- `firstNameMatchError` → If `true`, mismatch with first or given name
- `lastNameMatchError` → If `true`, mismatch with last or family name
- `birthDateMatchError` → If `true`, mismatch with birth date
- `mobilePhoneMatchError` → If `true`, mismatch with mobile phone number
- `idVerifiedMatchError` → If `true`, mismatch with identity verification

Account members whose membership status is `BindingUserError` can still access basic account and card information, but they can't perform any [sensitive operations](../../users/consent/index.mdx#sensitive), such as making a transfer or viewing their card numbers.

Other account members with the `canManageAccountMembership` permission and status `Enabled` can fix the mismatch.
If fraud is suspected, suspend the membership instead.

## Removing identity verification {#remove-verification}

Verifying your account members' identity is a required step in most circumstances.
However, with a detailed agreement with Swan, you might be allowed to bypass identity verification for certain membership permissions.

- To bypass identity verification, the account member **can't have** the following permissions:
    - `canManageAccountMembership`
    - `canInitiatePayments`
    - `canManageBeneficiaries`
- Whether the account member has `canViewAccount` and `CanManageCards` permissions doesn't impact removing identity verification.

Only after making an agreement with Swan, you can bypass identity verification with your API calls by setting the `idVerified` parameter to `false`.

Contact your Technical Account Manager to ask about removing identity verification.

## Closed accounts and memberships {#closed}

When Swan [accounts are closed](../index.mdx#closure), the account memberships are impacted as well.

As soon as an [account status](../index.mdx#statuses) changes to `Closing`, account members can no longer initiate payments or manage account memberships and beneficiaries.
When the account status changes to `Closed`, account members can view the account for one year, after which all memberships to the closed account are `Disabled`.

## Versioning {#versioning}

Account memberships have a `version` attribute.

When a new membership is added, the `version` is `0`, then increases by a factor of 1 with each change.
Changes includes including suspending, resuming, and updating the membership.

```
∗ The **requester** can be the account holder, the account's legal representative, or an account member with the `canManageAccountMembership` permission.
The requester provides consent (diagram line 4).
