Swan offers Mastercard debit cards to all of your account members.
Swan cards are accepted everywhere Mastercard is accepted, though there can be risk-based restrictions imposed in certain situations.
[Mastercard's exchange rate](https://www.mastercard.com/content/mastercardcom/global/en/personal/get-support/convert-currency.html) applies to card transactions outside of [SEPA](../payments/index.mdx#sepa).

Individual account holders are issued consumer debit cards, while company account holders receive business debit cards.
The fee per card depends on your contract with Swan and is detailed in your Swan Terms and Conditions.
Note that cards don't come with insurance.
