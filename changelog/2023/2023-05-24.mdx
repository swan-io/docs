<h4>New features</h4>

👩🏽‍💻 Subscribe to our new `User` webhooks to receive real-time updates on any changes related to your users.
You can track the identity verification ([identifications](/topics/users/identifications)) process and more.
You can also get the list of users who have connected to your project with the new API users query.

🤖 [Impersonate a user with a project access token](/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-impersonate) to unlock certain use cases.

💼 We're ready to onboard our first Partners to [collect French checks](/topics/merchants/checks).
Please contact us if you're interested in beta testing!

<h4>Improvements</h4>

🔍 A new filter `period` was added to the account statements collection. Use it to filter account statements, whether you create them when you need them or you generate them automatically.

🇪🇺 On your PDF account statements, amounts are now displayed in the local format based on the account language.
We'll continue to improve the localized experience.

👑 The project owner's legal representative can now see their card numbers with the API. Also, in Sandbox, promote any account holder in the project to project owner with the testing API mutation promoteAccountHolderToProjectOwner.

<h4>Bug fix</h4>

🇫🇷 From May 12th to May 15th, Bouygues Telecom blocked text message delivery to French phone numbers (+33), messages that included a link to authenticate.
As a quick fix, we will temporarily send https://link.swan.io instead of https://authmsg.co.

💳 In the `Card.Updated` webhook, `eventDate` changed to `updatedAt` (previously `createdAt`).

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

⏲️ To improve our webhook performance, we added a timeout of 15 seconds to endpoint requests. When there is no response after 15 seconds, the webhook fails and will automatically retry.

💥 In the `addCards` mutation, the input field `additionalEmbossedLine` is now **`additionalPrintedLine`** for consistency and user clarity.

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

📱 In **4 weeks**, Swan will stop sending a text message to users when their identity is successfully verified.
Why?
With the new `User` webhook, you can track their progress and notify them however you choose!
