:::warning Limited account transfer restrictions
When sending a first transfer to a limited account, users should send a SEPA Credit Transfer of €50 or less that won't cause the balance to exceed €150.

This is due to the following restrictions that apply while the account remains in `Limited` status:

- SEPA Credit Transfers exceeding €50 are automatically rejected.
- SEPA Credit Transfers that would cause the account balance to exceed €150 are automatically rejected.
- International Credit Transfers, regardless of their amount, are automatically rejected.
