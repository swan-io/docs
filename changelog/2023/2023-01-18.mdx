### New features

🎨 The Web Banking has a fresh new design for transaction history, members, and card tabs.
And guess what?
We're getting ready to share our code and design system with you.

🔐 Secure all webhooks by adding a secret in the HTTP Request.

🔁 Automatically trigger the [funding of a Swan account](/topics/accounts/funding/guide-initiate-request) based on pre-defined events without user consent.
Restricted to account funding SEPA Direct Debit B2B with rolling reserve.

### Improvements

🇫🇷 Automatically fetch UBOs for French registered companies with the `updateOnboardCompanyAccountHolder` mutation.
This was already available in the no-code interface and now it's in the API.

💸 [Indicate a `spendingLimit`](/topics/cards) when using the `addCard` mutation.
To avoid breaking changes, the `spendingLimit` is an optional input for the `addCard` mutation.

🤳🏾 Create a card and add it to Apple Pay or Google Pay simultaneously using the [multiple consent feature](/topics/users/consent/guide-create-multiconsent).

### Bug fix

💰 We have fixed some bugs on Capital Deposit:

- Account Holders linked to multiple Capital Deposits don't have status errors anymore.
- Shareholder status is now properly updated when the funds are deposited.
- We fixed an error that was preventing some Capital Deposits from moving to completion.

### Breaking changes

💥 We will begin using some changes we already warned you about, and have added them to the Graph.
To avoid breaking changes on your side, please take these into account:

- New types of Transaction `FeeTransaction` and `InternalDirectDebitTransaction`
- A new enum at Transaction level: `paymentProduct = Fees` and `transactionType = FeesOut`, `FeesIn`
- A new payment mandate type `InternalDirectDebitPaymentMandate`
- A new received payment mandate type `InternalReceivedDirectDebitMandate`
- A new rejection reason code on `SepaInstantCreditTransferOut` and `SepaInstantCreditTransferIn`
- A new enum at Onboarding level: `companyType = SelfEmployed`

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ In February we will start using a lot of changes that have been added to the Graph.
To avoid breaking changes on your side, please take these into account:

- New rejection reasons for `CardOut` transactions. The new values are: `RetryWithChipAndPin`, `PinRequiredForFurtherTransaction`, `InvalidSecurityNumber`, `InvalidExpirationDate`.
- New rejection reason codes for `SepaInstantCreditTransferOut` transactions. The new values are: `CreditorBankTechnicalErrorOccurred` and `CreditorBankTimeout`.
- New transaction types `SepaInstantCreditTransferInRecall` and `SepaInstantCreditTransferOutRecall`.
- Add `Refused` in `accountHolder.verificationStatus` enum
