### New features

🤳 Users can now [consent using biometry](/topics/users/consent). To try it out for yourself, just clear your browser data. During your next consent, we'll ask you to register your FaceId, TouchId, or Fingerprint. Passcode will only be requested if a user has changed their mobile device.

📲 Some of you wish to send notifications via your own app, to offer a great UX just like the best neobanks. This is now possible. Just [define your preferred consent notification channel](/topics/users/consent), SMS or App, by using the new `updateUserConsentSettings` mutation.

✅ Thanks to the new `updateOnboarding` and `finalizeOnboarding` mutations you are not obligated to use our #nocode interfaces. You can [onboard customers directly from your product](/topics/onboarding), if you prefer.

### Improvements

🔍 We added new account filters : `canManageAccountMembership`, `canManageBeneficiaries`, `canInitiatePayments` and new `accountMemberships` filters: `status`, `canInitiatePayments`, `canManageAccountMembership`, `canManageBeneficiaries`.

📜 The list of transactions associated to a received direct debit mandate can now be retrieved using the API.

🏃 The dashboard lets you sort webhook event logs using 2 new filters: `eventId` and `resourceId`. View each webhook's KPIs for the last 7 days: hits, counter, and error rate. We also added 2 new events: `Onboarding.created` and `Onboarding.updated`.

🚮 Transactions where `paymentProduct` is `SEPACreditTransfer` and status is `Upcoming` can now be canceled using the `cancelTransaction` mutation.

### Bug fixes

💳 When requesting physical cards, the Company Name and the Name/Last Name are now truncated to 38 characters. This is a mail delivery requirement.

🌍 The card language (used for 3DS, ATM screens and delivery envelopes) is dynamically assigned. Available languages: DE, FR, IT, NL, EN, ES. When a language is not available, the default language is EN.

### Breaking changes

🔢 [Pagination](/developers/using-api/pagination) on the `accountHolders`, `accountMemberships`, and `accounts` queries has been fixed. It might break if you implement the filter on the front-end. These queries now only return the requested number of items, rather than all items at once.
