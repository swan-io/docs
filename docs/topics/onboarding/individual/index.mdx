## Individual onboarding form {#onboarding-form}

Through the individual onboarding form, Swan collects the following information:

1. User's **email address**.
1. User's **country of residence** and **residence address**.
1. Basic details about the **user's employment** and **financial situation**. This information allows Swan to perform two essential tasks:
    * During onboarding, Swan completes an identity analysis (Know Your Customer, or KYC).
    * For the lifetime of the account, Swan monitors for fraud.
1. **Consent** to open the account (consent process requires a mobile device).

## Identify verification recommendations {#id-verification-recommendations}

Swan must verify the identity of every user.
Swan supports multiple types of identity verification, called `identificationLevels` in the API.

For individual onboarding, the following levels are recommended based on the account country.
Please refer to the [section on identity verification](https://docs.swan.io/concept/user#identification-level) for more information on identification levels.

| Account country | Recommended level<br/>for individuals | Other supported levels |
|---|---|---|
| :fr: France | ✓ **PVID** | Expert + first transfer<br/>QES |
| :de: Germany | ✓ **QES + first transfer** | *none* |
| :flag-nl: Netherlands | ✓ **Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| :es: Spain | ✓ **Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
