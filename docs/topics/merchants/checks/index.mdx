# French checks for merchants

:::caution beta
French checks are currently in private beta.
:::

Merchants can accept payments using French checks if the debtor's bank is located in France.

## About French checks for merchants {#about}

While paper checks are not the most convenient or secure payment method, they are still a valid way to exchange money.
Some users prefer checks, and merchants can accept French checks if they activate this payment method for accepting payments.

There isn't a Swan user interface for accepting checks.
This feature is only available using the API.

## Required API fields {#fields}

When declaring checks with the API, there are five mandatory API fields:

1. `amount`: monetary amount of the check (can't exceed 10 000€)
1. `currency`: `EUR` (only euros are supported)
1. `CMC7` (Caractères Magnétiques Codés à 7 bâtonnets): 31-digit code composed of 3 series of numbers
    - Series 1: check number; 7 digits
    - Series 2: interbank codes; 12 digits
    - Series 3: account number; 12 digits
1. `rlmcKey` (Recomposition de la Ligne Magnétique du Chèque): 2-digit code surrounded by chevrons `< >` or parentheses `( )` calculated based on the CMC7
1. `merchantProfileId`: your developers should enter the merchant's profile ID number

## R-transactions {#r-transactions}

### Rejected {#r-transactions-rejected}

Checks can be rejected by Swan's check provider and returned to the merchant by mail.

A check transaction might be rejected for the following reasons (this list is not exhaustive):

- Problem with the signature
- Suspicion of fraud
- Check was received by Swan's check provider more than 30 days after the check was declared

Merchants can resubmit rejected checks within 30 days of receipt.
They need to fix the issue and initiate a new `checkIn` transaction before sending the check to Swan's check provider.

### Returned {#r-transactions-returned}

Checks can be returned up to 11 business days after the transaction is `Booked`, and this window can be extended to 90 calendar days based on the reason for return.

A check transaction might be returned for the following reasons (this list is not exhaustive):

- Insufficient funds
- Account closed
- Loss or theft

By the time a check is returned, the merchant's account has already be credited.
Therefore, when Swan is notified that a `Booked` check has gone unpaid, a `checkInReturn` transaction is created automatically.

### Canceled {#r-transactions-canceled}

Creditors can cancel a received check with the `Upcoming` status.
In this case, the check status switches automatically to `Canceled`.
This transaction won't impact the account's available balance.

Additionally, all checks not sent to Swan's check provider within 30 days of being declared will be automatically `Canceled`.
