### New features

💸 Offer bulk credit transfer capabilities to your end users.
Your end users can now export a list of credit transfers from their accounting or payment tool into a CSV file, then upload the file into their Web Banking app.
As a result, they'll initiate multiple credit transfers simultaneously (bulk payments).

🏦 Swan is now available for [Open Banking payment initiators](https://www.swan.io/psd2-api).
They can connect to our API to initiate SEPA Credit Transfers and Instant SEPA Credit Transfers.
Contact your Account Manager if you're interested in this feature.

### Upcoming breaking changes

🙅🏾 In 4 weeks, the status `Canceled` will be added to `CapitalDepositCase`, and the status `CapitalDepositCanceled` to `Shareholder`.
