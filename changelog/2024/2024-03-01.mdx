<h3>New features</h3>

üìñ Documentation has always been a priority at Swan.
Today, we introduce the next era of our docs, with a **stronger information hierarchy**, dedicated [product](/welcome), [Developers](/developers), and [Partnership](/partnership) sections, and a **powerful search** that unites everything‚Äîincluding [API Reference](https://api-reference.swan.io/).
There's **more content**, and everything was created with **accessibility** in mind.
Discover the new docs.swan.io!

üõ°Ô∏è We added new user roles to the Dashboard!
Open your Team Management section to edit access for your team.
This improves data privacy & security.

<h3>Improvements</h3>

üí≥ To avoid unwanted notifications for `Suspended` physical cards (amongst other things), [3DS Strong Customer Authentication](/topics/payments/cards/#3ds) for card transactions on eCommerce websites won't be triggered for a `card` that doesn't have the status `Enabled`, or a `physicalCard` that doesn't have the status `Activated`.
Authorization received for cards that aren't `Enabled` or `Activated` will still appear as `Rejected`.

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

‚ö†Ô∏è Queries using [pagination](/developers/using-api/pagination) are now limited to 100 elements to load per request.
