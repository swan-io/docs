  <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è **Upcoming breaking changes**</summary>

  <div>

‚úâÔ∏è Starting **July 21st**, the `shippingProvider` field in `PhysicalCardToActivateStatusInfo` and `PhysicalCardRenewedStatusInfo` will be migrated from a `String` to an `ENUM`. 
On the same day, the [shipping provider](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/shipping-provider/) values `La Poste` and `CORREOS` will be removed.

üí∂ On **August 1st**, we're removing the `merchantPayment` field in the `InitiateCheckMerchantPaymentSuccessPayload`, use [`checkMerchantPayment`](/topics/merchants/online/checks/guide-initiate) instead. We're also deprecating `merchantPayment`.

üõë Starting **August 18th**, the `initiateCheckMerchantPayment` mutation will return a new rejection: `MerchantPaymentAlreadyExistsRejection`. This occurs when **you try to create a merchant payment** and the **CMC7 value** is already used by an existing payment that hasn't been `Rejected` or `Canceled`. If the existing payment with the same CMC7 *was* `Rejected` or `Canceled`, your mutation will still succeed.

üí≥ Starting **August 21st**, refund transactions will be linked to the `paymentId` of their original debit authorization when referenced by merchants. This change affects you only if you expect debit clearing transactions on a debit authorization.
