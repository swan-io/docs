# Get a quote

Get a quote for a Swan International Credit Transfer.

Call the `internationalCreditTransferQuote` query to get a quote for your transfer, which includes:

- Current `exchangeRate`.
- Amount you're sending in your currency (`sourceAmount`).
- Fees (`feeAmount`).
- Amount your recipient should receive in their currency (`targetAmount`).

:::note For information only
The exchange rate in the quote is for your information only, so **running this query is optional**.
Only after initiating an International Credit Transfer is the exchange rate locked for one business day.
