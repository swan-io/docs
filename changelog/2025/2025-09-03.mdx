## New features

💳 We've added a new **Preview** section to our API documentation, providing an early look at upcoming and beta features. 
Note that documentation for preview features may change before they're officially released.

## Improvements

✋ You can now [cancel merchant SEPA Direct Debit payments](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/#canceling) using the `cancelMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Check the `availableToCancel` balance to determine if a specific payment can be canceled.

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ Starting **October 1st**, we're removing the `paymentId` field from the `initiateSepaDirectDebitMerchantPayment` mutation. 
Instead, retrieve the ID from the `merchantPayment` field, which now returns the Merchant Payment object.
We're also deprecating the `paymentId` field today.

⚠️ Starting **October 31st**, the `taxIdentificationNumber` will be mandatory at onboarding when the `accountCountry` and the account holder's residency address country don't match, due to [CRS regulation](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/jersey-guidance-notes-crs.pdf) requirements.
For example, Spanish residents opening French accounts will need to provide their tax identification number.
