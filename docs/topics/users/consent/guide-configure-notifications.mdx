# Configure consent notifications

You can declare a preferred notification channel for your users and configure how your consent notifications appear.

Please note that if you're using **Swan's Web Banking interface**, Swan sends a text message to your users for one-time passwords, logins, and consents, regardless of preferred channel and configuration.

:::info Timeout
Your integration has three seconds to respond to a consent notification.
If your response is anything other than a 200 OK HTTP, or there's no response at all, Swan cancels the consent and redirects your user.

## Declare preferred notification channel {#declare-channel}

You can specify how your user would like to receive consent notifications, referred to as their preferred channel.

1. Call the `updateUserConsentSettings` mutation with a project access token.
1. Enter the user's `userId`.
1. Choose the preferred channel:
   1. `Sms` (default value): Swan sends a text message to the user with the SCA link to open on their mobile device.
   1. `App`: You receive a notification, then send the SCA link to your user yourself.

## Configure consent notification {#configure-channel}

Along with a notification, you'll receive an `authorizationUrl` and the `consent` object to display to your user on their mobile.
On desktop, Swan displays the `consentUrl`.

While consent is ongoing, the user's mobile plays a repeated image with your accent color and logo.
