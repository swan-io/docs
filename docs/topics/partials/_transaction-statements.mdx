Your users might need to provide proof of a transaction to a third party.
For example, they might need to prove their purchase to use a warranty.

You can [generate transaction statements](../payments/overview/guide-generate-transaction-statement.mdx) for `Booked` transactions with the API.
When the statement is ready, Swan emails you a link to download the statement.
You have seven days to download the statement before the link expires.
