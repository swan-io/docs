### Improvements

📃 Use the newly introduced **Dashboard > Data > Onboarding > Supporting documents** page to manage the document collection during the account opening process. Learn more about the [supporting document collection](https://docs.swan.io/topics/onboarding/documents/).

🧪 [Simulate](https://docs.swan.io/topics/onboarding/documents/sandbox) a supporting document status update.

⏸️ Suspending an account now triggers an `Account.Updated` webhook.

### Upcoming breaking changes
⚠ In **2 weeks**, we'll reject any input of the "_" character in the `reference` field, and sanitize it in the `label` field within the `initiateCreditTransfers` mutation, as it's not authorized in SEPA messages.For the `reference` field, ensure that  the content:
  - Doesn't start or end with a "/"
  - Doesn’t have "//"
  - Follows this pattern: (regex [A-Za-z0-9 -?.+,/’])

💸 The `beneficiaryId` input field for the mutation `initiateCreditTransfers` has been deprecated, and will be removed in 4 weeks.

ℹ️ In the upcoming months, we'll remove the requirement of one unique phone number per user. While each phone number will remain linked to only one user at a time, it can **later** be reused by different users, like employees, at **separate** times.
