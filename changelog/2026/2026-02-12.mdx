## Improvements

Starting **February 26**, B2B received direct debit mandates will return to `ConsentInitiationPending` status instead of `Canceled` when consent is refused or expires. This will allow end users to retry activating the mandate using the [`enableReceivedDirectDebitMandate`](https://api-reference.swan.io/mutations/enable-received-direct-debit-mandate/) mutation.
